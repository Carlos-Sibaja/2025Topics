194,"Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News  news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton’s attempt to topple Republican Sen. John Cornyn in a Senate primary next year kicks off one of the most intense contests of the 2026 elections — a GOP-versus-GOP battle between two men who have been sparring for years and vying for President Donald Trump’s attention.   Cornyn is a fixture of the Republican Party in Texas, serving in its highest offices for more than 30 years and becoming a key voice on Capitol Hill. Paxton, the third-term attorney general who survived a bipartisan impeachment last year in part thanks to support from Trump and conservative activist allies, believes there’s an opening to cut the incumbent down from the right.  Now, both sides are aligning themselves with Trump amid the possibility of an endorsement that could tip the primary.  Whether one comes or not, one thing is clear. “This is gonna be the nastiest race in the modern era of Texas politics, period,” former Travis County GOP chairman Matt Mackowiak said.   Paxton immediately attacked Cornyn for having “turned his back on President Trump,” pointing to comments Cornyn made in 2023 about Trump’s indictment over his handling of classified documents, as well as the senator’s comments that he didn’t think Trump “could win the presidency” after Trump was found liable for sexual abuse in a civil case that same year. Paxton has also targeted Cornyn over his votes on issues including guns and immigration to try to argue that he is more aligned with conservative values. “While John was criticizing Trump and suggesting he shouldn’t run, I was at Mar-a-Lago” for Trump’s presidential announcement speech, Paxton told “The Mark Davis Show” in Dallas.   ""If he had the record of [Texas GOP Sen.] Ted Cruz, would I be here? Absolutely not,"" Paxton continued. ""This isn’t about what he’s saying and the love he suddenly has for President Trump and the love he has for all of our issues now. This isn’t about that love. I don’t believe that love, I believe in action."" Cornyn, though, also made an appeal to Trump’s interests, telling reporters at the Capitol on Wednesday that Paxton’s Senate bid is a “con man’s vanity project.”   “The biggest potential loser is President Trump’s agenda,” Cornyn said of the primary challenge.  “Mr. Paxton has a checkered background, he is a con man and a fraud, and I think the people of Texas know that, but this is what will be litigated during the course of this campaign. I am not going to turn over the Senate seat that was once held by Sam Houston to someone like him,” he added, a reference to the 2023 impeachment trial of Paxton, after which he survived a conviction vote in the state Senate.    “It’s unclear to me exactly what is motivating Mr. Paxton other than vanity and personal ambition,” Cornyn continued.  In the months before Paxton jumped in — and in the hours since — Cornyn has made clear he’s hugging Trump as tight as he can. He posted on X a photo of him reading Trump’s “The Art of the Deal” and called it “recommended” reading; he took to the Senate floor to defend Trump aide and billionaire Elon Musk (whose businesses have a significant footprint in Texas) after protests at Tesla dealerships; and he has been framing himself as one of Trump’s top allies in the Senate.   The roots of this clash between another establishment-insurgent pair of Republicans run deep, part of a decade-plus battle within the Texas GOP that has ousted legislative leaders, fueled Cruz's rise, fanned the flames of Paxton’s impeachment, and led to proxy wars up and down the ballot.   Paxton had been telegraphing a run against Cornyn from the right for more than a year. In early 2024, Paxton lambasted the senator as “anti-Trump [and] anti-gun” in a post on X, adding that “Texans deserve another conservative Senator.”   Cornyn reposted the message and replied: “Hard to run from prison, Ken,” a reference to the investigations that led to the impeachment trial. (The Associated Press reported this month that the Justice Department decided last year not to prosecute Paxton over corruption allegations.)  Brendan Steinhauser, a longtime GOP consultant who served as Cornyn’s campaign manager in the past but is unaffiliated in this race, told NBC News it’s no surprise to see Cornyn campaign with an eye on Trump.   “If you’re Senator Cornyn, you’re going to be campaigning on all the ways that you have supported and worked with the president, you’re going to talk about all the policies where you align, you’re going to talk about helping to get all of his judicial nominees through,” he said.  While a potential endorsement from Trump remains a major question, Cornyn does have support from Senate Republicans. Sen. Tim Scott, of South Carolina, who chairs the National Republican Senatorial Committee, has made his case for Cornyn to White House officials. Scott also told Rep. Wesley Hunt, R-Texas, who has also been weighing a Senate run, that the NRSC is behind Cornyn, according to a source familiar with the discussions.   “John Cornyn is a leader who delivers on President Trump’s agenda and for the people of Texas in the U.S. Senate,” Scott said in a statement to NBC News. “He’s a proven fighter, man of faith and essential part of the Republican Senate Majority.”   Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., has also been publicly backing Cornyn and recently told CNN he was hopeful Trump would back Cornyn in the race.   Asked Wednesday if he has personally asked Trump to endorse Cornyn, Thune told reporters at the Capitol: “Well, we’re having conversations about all of the races on the map. When we have anything to report, we’ll let you know.”  Senate Leadership Fund, the main GOP super PAC involved in Senate races, which is aligned with Republican leadership, indicated it is also in Cornyn's corner. ""Leader John Thune, NRSC Chairman Tim Scott, and many of their colleagues have expressed great admiration and support for Senator John Cornyn and his years of service to the people of Texas,"" SLF Chairman Cory Gardner, a former senator from Colorado, said in a statement to NBC News. ""The Senate Leadership Fund fully intends on seeing him reelected next November."" Mackowiak, a longtime Texas political consultant, told NBC News that he sees Paxton’s early announcement as an indication of two things: The attorney general sees an opening, but he knows he needs time to raise the money required to combat Cornyn and the power of incumbency.   “Paxton’s never run a race this complicated, this expensive against someone as accomplished and serious as John Cornyn,"" he said. ""John Cornyn has never been challenged by someone that has the statewide profile and grassroots enthusiasm Paxton has.""  But Mackowiak argued that while Paxton has sought to go on offense early, that dynamic may not stick, and that the events that led to Paxton’s impeachment trial (which divided Republicans in the state) will likely be relitigated.   “He is going to be playing a lot more defense than he even understands. I think because he got through impeachment, these issues are behind him. They’re not,” he said.   One potential wrinkle, particularly if Hunt or another Republican decides to jump in, is Texas’ runoff rules. If no candidate wins the majority of the vote in the primary, the top two move on to a one-on-one runoff election.   Cornyn has never lost an election in Texas, and he’s never been forced to a runoff by any of his opponents (who have largely challenged him from the right). But the prospect of a split field leading to a runoff is another complicating factor, with both Mackowiak and Steinhauser noting that runoff electorates typically favor the candidate with more grassroots conservative support.  The Texas race could have broader implications for the fight for the Senate next year as Republicans look to defend their slim majority.    Democrats need to net three seats to take control of the Senate, but they face an uphill battle with a short list of targets. Just one Republican — Maine’s Susan Collins — is running in a state that former Vice President Kamala Harris carried in November. Republicans, meanwhile, are looking to grow their majority by targeting Democratic-held seats in battleground states.  But Cornyn said a competitive election in Texas could put a strain on Republicans nationally by diverting money away from other key battlegrounds.   “We’re going to end up spending hundreds of millions of dollars, potentially, on this race in Texas, because we can’t lose the seat in Texas,” said Cornyn, a former NRSC chairman. “And that is money that can’t be used in places like Michigan, New Hampshire and Georgia in the midterm elections.”  Democrats have long coveted the idea of flipping Texas, with former Rep. Beto O’Rourke coming close to defeating Cruz in the blue wave year of 2018. But Trump expanded his margin last year in Texas compared to 2020, carrying Texas by 14 percentage points as Cruz defeated former Democratic Rep. Colin Allred by 9 points.  Allred told The Dallas Morning News last month that he is “seriously considering” another run for Senate against Cornyn. Cruz, meanwhile, told reporters Wednesday that he is staying neutral in this year’s Senate primary, saying both Paxton and Cornyn are friends.   “I have worked closely with both of them. I respect them both,” Cruz said. “And I trust the voters of Texas to make that decision.”  A divisive GOP primary could play into Democrats’ hands — especially if Paxton is the nominee. In the meantime, Democrats are watching the GOP primary process play out in Texas and other states. Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee spokesperson Maeve Coyle noted that former New Hampshire GOP Gov. Chris Sununu announced Tuesday that he would not be running for that state’s open Senate seat.   “As Republicans face a nasty primary in Texas and an embarrassing recruitment failure in New Hampshire — coupled with a building midterm backlash across the map driven by their threats to Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and their push to spike costs for families — Democrats will look for every opportunity to put them on defense,” Coyle said.

In today’s edition, we dive into President Donald Trump’s sudden decision to pause many of his new tariffs. Plus, we explain why Texas is set to host one of the most intense contests of the 2026 midterms. And Andrea Mitchell previews the upcoming nuclear talks between the United States and Iran.  Sign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here. — Adam Wollner One week after his “Liberation Day,” President Donald Trump said he was pausing higher targeted tariffs for most countries for 90 days, a stunning reversal in his trade war that sent markets reeling.  In a social media post just before 1:30 p.m., Trump wrote that he came to the decision because more than 75 trading partners did not retaliate and have reached out to the United States to “discuss” some of the issues he had raised.   But the pause didn’t apply to China, which has retaliated with 84% hikes. Trump instead raised duties for it to 125%, effective immediately.    Zooming out: The trade war isn’t exactly over, and the pause didn’t return the world to the time before Trump touched off the global instability. A 10% across-the-board duty will remain — including for some products from Canada and Mexico.  The White House wouldn’t say which countries would be covered by the pause. Earlier Wednesday the European Union voted to impose fresh retaliatory duties, but they aren’t set to take effect until next week.  And separate tariffs on imported autos, steel and aluminum will remain, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said later — while planned tariffs on items like lumber and pharmaceuticals are still on.  How Wall Street responded: Markets soared on the surprising news Wednesday, with the S&P 500 climbing more than 9%, the tech-heavy Nasdaq closing up more than 12% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average ending nearly 3,000 points higher.   Goldman Sachs lowered its odds of a recession but said it is still forecasting minimal economic growth and a 45% probability of a recession given the remaining tariffs in place. What Trump said: Trump appeared to dig in on his tariff plan just hours earlier, telling Americans “BE COOL” on Truth Social. And he suggested not that long ago that the tariffs could be permanent.   “I thought that people were jumping a little bit out of line. They were getting yippie, you know, they were getting a little bit yippie, a little bit afraid,” he told reporters at the White House. “So we’ll see how it all works out. I think it’s going to work out amazing,” he added. Read more →  Related reads: Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton’s attempt to topple Republican Sen.

Leading the talks for Iran: Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, a veteran of nuclear negotiations. But so far, the two sides can’t even agree on the nature of the talks.  President Donald Trump told reporters they would be holding direct talks, which Iran has rejected since Trump withdrew in 2018 from the multinational Iran nuclear deal President Barack Obama’s secretary of state, John Kerry, negotiated three years earlier. Araghchi says they’ve agreed only to hold indirect talks, exchanging proposals through diplomatic go-betweens as they’d done with the Biden administration for two years, which went nowhere.  The stakes are serious: Iran has been processing nuclear fuel so rapidly it now has the ability to create one bomb within a week or two, according to the United Nations, former Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Trump administration warnings — though it would still take an estimated year or longer for Tehran to be able to create a warhead small enough for one of its ballistic missiles to carry.  Why are the talks so critical? Trump warned Monday that “it’s getting to be very dangerous territory, and hopefully those talks will be successful. And I think it would be in Iran’s best interests if they are successful.” Last month, he was more explicit, telling “Meet the Press” moderator Kristen Welker, “If they don’t make a deal, there will be bombing, and it will be bombing the likes of which they have never seen before.”  Multiple U.S. officials told NBC News that Iran is vulnerable to an attack: Israel’s retaliatory strike against Iran last fall eliminated many of Tehran’s air defenses. Israel has also killed the leader of Hezbollah, Iran’s proxy and front line of defense in neighboring Lebanon. Hamas’ leaders in Gaza, also Iran’s proxies, are gone. So is Tehran’s powerful ally in Syria, Bashar al-Assad. Trump has repeatedly signaled that he doesn’t want a war with Iran. To avoid one, the two sides have to at least agree, finally, to come face to face. That’s all From the Politics Desk for now. Today’s newsletter was compiled by Adam Wollner.

206,"Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News  news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time President Donald Trump directed federal agencies Wednesday to revoke the security clearances and review the activities of two high-level former government officials who questioned his election fraud claims and his conduct in his first term. Christopher Krebs, the former head of the federal government's top cybersecurity agency, said Joe Biden won the 2020 elections, contradicting Trump's claim that the election was stolen.  Miles Taylor, a former Department of Homeland Security official, wrote an anonymous memoir that criticized Trump's handling of classified documents and other conduct during his first term. One memorandum Trump signed directed the attorney general and the homeland security secretary to ""take all appropriate action to review"" Krebs' activities. Another directed the homeland security secretary to review Taylor’s activities as a government employee. The memo relating to Krebs described him as a ""significant bad-faith actor who weaponized and abused his Government authority.""  The other memo said Taylor ""stoked dissension by manufacturing sensationalist reports on the existence of a supposed 'resistance' within the Federal Government."" Krebs declined to comment. Taylor said on X that he wasn't surprised by Trump's actions.  “I said this would happen,” Taylor wrote. “Dissent isn’t unlawful. It certainly isn’t treasonous. America is headed down a dark path.” He added: “Never has a man so inelegantly proved another man’s point.” Taylor wrote an anonymous op-ed while he was working at the Department of Homeland Security in which he said many senior administration officials were trying to limit Trump’s impulses and frustrate his agenda.  In his memoir, Taylor describes having heard about Trump’s interest in “tapping” White House aides’ phones in a bid to stanch media leaks. Krebs was the first director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, which during the Trump administration began offering cybersecurity and physical security help to state and local election officials.  Trump fired Krebs in a tweet in November 2020 over the agency’s Rumor Control website, which corrected falsehoods about election integrity, many of which Trump and his allies promoted. Krebs was among the most vocal government officials debunking baseless claims about election manipulation, particularly addressing a conspiracy theory centered on Dominion Voting Systems machines that Trump's lawyers have pushed. As a prominent critic of Trump’s false claims that the election 2020 was stolen, Krebs has been a consistent target for Trump.  Rep. Jim Himes, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, condemned Trump’s attack on Krebs. “Krebs executed his constitutional and professional duty by debunking lies about the 2020 election,"" Hime said in an email. ""That Donald Trump would wield the Justice Department against him for such an act represents yet another chilling step towards authoritarianism.""

207,"Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News  news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time In the wake of President Donald Trump’s announcement Wednesday afternoon that he was pausing country-by-country tariffs by 90 days, some experts — as well as critics of Trump and social media users — are raising questions about a statement he posted earlier in the day that may have indicated the massive sell-off in stocks in recent days was coming to an end.   Not long after trading opened at 9:30 a.m. Wednesday, Trump took to his Truth Social platform and wrote: “BE COOL! Everything is going to work out well. The USA will be bigger and better than ever before!” Four minutes later, he wrote: “THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!! DJT” Just before 1:30 p.m., Trump announced the pause, sending stocks soaring. The tech-heavy Nasdaq index had its biggest one-day gain since 2008, rising nearly 12%, while the S&P 500 climbed 9.5% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 8%, or about 2,800 points.  Trump could have been generally urging people to buy into the market while prices were relatively low. That was the response Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick gave when he was asked about the posts Wednesday evening on CNBC. “Donald Trump understands that … America is the greatest country, all right? We are the greatest country, and we have the capacity for incredible greatness. But someone needs to take the shackles off.” But on social media, some users raised the prospect — without evidence — of market manipulation, while others began referring to the market’s sharp turn upward as the “Trump Pump.”    There is no evidence to suggest that Trump was seeking to manipulate markets or that he or any of his advisers acted on inside information For Richard Painter, chief ethics lawyer for former President George W. Bush, who now teaches government ethics and security regulation at the University of Minnesota’s law school, the morning posts, at a minimum, leave Trump open to questions about his intentions.   “This is a scenario that could expose the president to accusations that he engaged in market manipulation,” Painter said.  Even before he’d been sworn in for his second term, Trump faced insider-trading criticisms amid the launch of his $TRUMP meme coin. In that incident, the Trump Organization was explicit that a group of investors who were helping launch the coin stood to benefit from its release assuming its price went up. Still, reports showed other investors reaping outsized profits from the launch, including one crypto-wallet owner or owners who earned $109 million, according to a New York Times analysis. Some Democrats were quick to blast Trump’s actions on Wednesday. ""An insider trading scandal is brewing,"" Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., posted on X. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., told NBC News that the Trump administration is “replete with grifters” and that “corruption is its middle name.”  “Insider trading is a real threat, and I hope there will be a surge of penetrating investigations into the potential for manipulation and insider trading of securities,” Blumenthal said, “since the knowledge of what Trump’s plans have been and may be is widely spread.” Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif. — a frequent object of Trump’s scorn — also suggested an inquiry was warranted. “Trump is creating giant market fluctuations with his on-again, off-again tariffs,” Schiff wrote on social media. “These constant gyrations in policy provide dangerous opportunities for insider trading. Who in the administration knew about Trump’s latest tariff flip flop ahead of time? Did anyone buy or sell  stocks, and profit at the public’s expense? I’m writing to the White House — the public has a right to know.” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., pointed to the upcoming May 15 deadline for members of Congress to submit their financial disclosure reports, writing on X, ""Any member of Congress who purchased stocks in the last 48 hours should probably disclose that now. I’ve been hearing some interesting chatter on the floor."" A White House spokesman rejected the Democrats’ assertions. “It is the responsibility of the President of the United States to reassure the markets and Americans about their economic security in the face of nonstop media fearmongering,” White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement. “Instead of grasping at straws to try landing a punch on President Trump, Democrats should focus on working with the administration to restore American Greatness.” A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment. The Securities and Exchange Commission did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Painter said the incident could result in investigations “into who knew what and when before [Trump] announced he was going to postpone the tariffs on all the countries except for China.” “This was a terrible idea to make those posts,” Painter said of Trump’s suggestion that it was “a great time to buy.”  Painter further admonished Trump, saying, “I would hope that he would focus on doing his job — and try to calm the markets and have a predictable trade policy and let the markets do their thing without the White House giving what appears to be investment advice.” Rob Wile is a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist covering breaking business stories for NBCNews.com. © 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"
209,"Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News  news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time HONG KONG — The increasingly vicious trade war between Washington and Beijing took another turn Wednesday when China imposed an additional 50% tariff on imports from the U.S., hiking its levies on American imports to 84%. The tit-for-tat escalation came hours after President Donald Trump’s 104% tariffs on Chinese imports went into effect, including 50% Trump added Monday. Later Wednesday, Trump increased the overall U.S. tariff on Chinese goods to 125%, even as he paused higher targeted tariffs on other countries for 90 days while keeping a 10% baseline tariff in place for all countries. Trump’s 50% tariff is a “mistake upon another mistake,” China’s Customs Tariff Commission said in a statement earlier Wednesday, adding that the world’s two biggest economies should “resolve differences through equal dialogue based on mutual respect.”  The effect of China’s 84% tariff may be somewhat limited because China imports only about $160 billion a year in U.S. goods compared with the more than $400 billion in goods it exports to the U.S. “I don’t think they can match in the economic realm, because the relationship is so unbalanced,” said Rick Waters, the Singapore-based director of the Carnegie China think tank. “So what they tend to do is move into adjacent realms to exact a price.”  Here's a look at some of the other measures China might take.  China could greatly increase tariffs on U.S. agricultural products, or even stop importing them completely. “I think there’s a very high chance that China will stop agricultural imports from the U.S. altogether,” said Tianchen Xu, a Beijing-based economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit, a financial forecasting service. “It’s a weapon targeting Trump’s supporter base,” he added.  Soybeans, which are crushed to make protein-rich animal feed ingredients and vegetable oils, have been at the heart of the U.S.-China trade dispute for some time. U.S. exports of soybeans to China fell 75% after China imposed a retaliatory 25% tariff on them in 2018, during Trump’s first-term trade war with Beijing. The Trump administration announced $12 billion in subsidies for farmers to offset the impact, and it has again promised to step in if the latest round of tariffs hurts the industry further. China could also put further restrictions on American poultry products, having announced an import ban on two U.S. companies last week. China, which frequently trades places with North America as the world’s largest box office, is a crucial market for Hollywood films. Though China has an annual quota for the number of foreign movies that can appear in its theaters, it could ban Hollywood films altogether. American movies have already been declining in popularity in recent years as U.S.-China trade tensions have escalated. There were no Hollywood films among China’s 10 highest-grossing movies in 2023, in stark contrast to 2012, when seven of the top 10 highest-grossing movies were U.S.-made, according to Maoyan, a Chinese movie-ticketing and data platform.  The U.S. has a large trade deficit with China in goods, but it comes out ahead when it comes to services such as finance, consulting and law. U.S. data lists China as its fifth-largest export market for services, according to a report by China’s State Council released Wednesday. China could target the U.S. services sector, for example, by excluding American companies from government procurement processes or restricting their cooperation with Chinese firms. The U.S. has long accused China of stealing its intellectual property. But Beijing also has its own growing intellectual property interests, and it could investigate U.S. companies in China in an effort to protect them. China and the U.S. have made progress on stemming the international flow of precursor ingredients for fentanyl, some of which originate in China and are then processed into the deadly opioid in countries such as Mexico before being smuggled into the U.S.  But China could bring that cooperation to a halt in response to Trump’s tariffs. “Out of humanitarian considerations, China has provided various forms of assistance to the U.S.,” Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said last month. “The U.S. should not repay goodwill with hostility.” Waters said it would be “counterproductive” for China to suspend cooperation on fentanyl. “It’s just going to cement narratives in the U.S. that they’re weaponizing drugs against us,” he said.

Trump instead raised duties for it to 125%, effective immediately.    “Based on the lack of respect that China has shown to the World’s Markets, I am hereby raising the Tariff charged to China by the United States of America to 125%, effective immediately,” he wrote. “At some point, hopefully in the near future, China will realize that the days of ripping off the U.S.A., and other Countries, is no longer sustainable or acceptable.”  But the trade war isn’t exactly over, and the pause didn’t return the world to the time before Trump touched off the global instability; a 10% across-the-board duty will remain. For Canada and Mexico, goods covered by the U.S., Canada and Mexico trade agreement will continue to have no tariffs, while products that aren't exempt under the trade deal will have a 25% tariff. Canadian energy and fertilizer products will have a 10% tariff. It wasn’t immediately clear which countries the pause would cover; the White House wouldn’t say. Earlier Wednesday, the European Union voted to impose fresh retaliatory duties, but they aren’t set to take effect until next week.   And separate tariffs on imported autos, steel and aluminum will remain, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said later — while planned tariffs on items like lumber and pharmaceuticals are still on.  It’s not clear what prompted Trump to change his mind — he appeared to dig in just hours earlier, telling Americans “BE COOL” in a Truth Social post, and he suggested not that long ago that the tariffs could be permanent.   “I did a 90-day pause for the people that didn’t retaliate, because I told them, ‘If you retaliate, we’re going to double it,’” Trump said Wednesday. “And that’s what I did with China, because they did retaliate. So we’ll see how it all works out. I think it’s going to work out amazing.”  But markets have been in stunning turmoil — major stock indexes shed trillions of dollars in value, while alarming signals from the bond market set Wall Street on edge.   When a false-at-the-time headline suggesting Trump would take a 90-day pause shot around the internet Monday, markets briefly surged. And a growing chorus of business leaders and Trump’s allies have come out publicly against the tariffs, including Tesla CEO Elon Musk.  Markets soared on the surprising news Wednesday, with the S&P 500 climbing more than 9%, the tech-heavy Nasdaq closing up more than 12% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average ending nearly 3,000 points higher. Among the big gainers: Tesla stock was up 22%. Despite the gains, all three indexes were down from where they were a month ago and at the start of the year, and some investors questioned what the recent volatility could mean for the U.S. stock market longer-term. ""My portfolio of defensive stocks is green so I don’t begrudge today’s market. But I ask you, would you want to own highly volatile US stocks whose price depends on whether POTUS had a good night’s sleep and woke up the next morning to reverse yesterday’s policies?"" billionaire investor Bill Gross said on X. Goldman Sachs lowered its odds of a recession but said it is still forecasting minimal economic growth and a 45% probability of a recession given the remaining tariffs. Borrowing costs — which had surged early Wednesday as the tariffs took effect — also eased slightly, though not substantially, as some investors may fear a lingering fallout.   Trump has been talking about tariffs as the solution for U.S. economic problems since before he became president; he branded April 2 — when he unveiled the plan — “Liberation Day,” saying it would end decades of the country’s being “looted, pillaged, raped and plundered” by other countries.  The global markets recoiled, and last week $6.6 trillion alone was wiped out. Yet Trump and his allies had doubled down until Wednesday, arguing tariffs were necessary to return manufacturing to the United States and fill the nation’s coffers with trillions of dollars in revenue that could be used to pay down debt or offset tax cuts.   It’s not clear how the White House expects the policies to fuel big gains now. With the lower 10% tariff rate left in place, there will be less incentive for companies to relocate production to the United States and less revenue being generated.  After the news, Bessent sought to make the about-face into a negotiating tactic, insisting it was a way to scare countries to come to the negotiating table by demonstrating how high the United States was going to go.    “President Trump created maximum negotiating leverage for himself,” he said.   It’s unclear how successful the United States will be at negotiating new trade agreements with other countries given Trump’s on-again, off-again threats over the past several months. Previously, he had threatened sweeping tariffs on all imports from Mexico and Canada before he walked most of them back.   And while markets surged higher Wednesday following Trump’s pause, economic uncertainty remains over what will come next in the U.S. trade war with China, which exports more than $400 billion worth of goods to the United States each year.   Under Trump’s new tariffs, the cost for U.S. companies importing goods from China has more than doubled. Those products include everything from toys and sneakers to televisions and iPhones.   U.S. companies exporting their products to China are also caught up in the fray after China increased its tariffs on American goods like agriculture products and machinery. But the White House is downplaying that risk.   “What I am certain of is that what China is doing will affect their economy much more than ours because they have an export-driven, flood-the-world-with-cheap-exports model,” Bessent said.  Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said on X that he sat with Trump as he posted the initial message, adding: “The world is ready to work with President Trump to fix global trade, and China has chosen the opposite direction.”  The Trump administration will now face the daunting task of trying to negotiate dozens of potentially complex and intricate trade deals in a three-month period.  ""That is a huge task to negotiate simultaneously with that many trading partners over that many issues,” said Greta Peisch, who was general counsel for the U.S. trade representative’s office during the Biden administration. “We have tariffs, non-tariff barriers, other non-trade related matters, all of those issues can get quite complicated quite quickly. Even with just a handful of trading partners, that would be a large undertaking."" Rob Wile is a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist covering breaking business stories for NBCNews.com.

President Donald Trump pulled back Wednesday on a series of harsh tariffs targeting friends and foes alike in an audacious bid to remake the global economic order.  Trump's early afternoon announcement followed a harrowing week in which Republican lawmakers and confidants privately warned him that the tariffs could wreck the economy. His own aides had quietly raised alarms about the financial markets before he suspended a tariff regime that he had unveiled with a flourish just one week earlier in a Rose Garden ceremony. Follow live politics coverage here The stock market rose immediately after the about-face, ending days of losses that have forced older Americans who've been sinking their savings into 401(k)s to rethink their retirement plans. Ahead of Trump's announcement, some of his advisers had been in a near panic about the bond markets, according to a senior administration official. Interest rates on 10-year Treasury bonds had been rising, contrary to what normally happens when stock prices fall and investors seek safety in treasuries. The unusual dynamic meant that at the same time the tariffs could push up prices, people would be paying more to buy homes or pay off credit card debt because of higher interest rates. Businesses looking to expand would pay more for new loans. Two of Trump's most senior advisers, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, presented a united front Wednesday, urging him to suspend the tariffs in light of the bond market, the administration official said. In a social media post, Trump announced a 90-day pause that he said he’ll use to negotiate deals with dozens of countries that have expressed openness to revising trade terms that he contends exploit American businesses and workers. One exception is China. Trump upped the tariff on the country’s biggest geopolitical rival to 125%, part of a tit-for-tat escalation in an evolving trade war. Trump reversed course one week after he appeared in the Rose Garden and unveiled his plan to bring jobs back to the United States. Displaying a chart showing the new, elevated tariffs that countries would face, Trump proclaimed, “My fellow Americans, this is Liberation Day.” It proved short-lived. Markets plunged in anticipation of heightened trade wars, wiping out trillions of dollars in wealth. Democrats seized on the issue, looking to undercut a source of Trump’s popular appeal: the view that he can be trusted to steer the nation’s economy.  “Donald Trump’s market crash has vaporized a whopping $104,000 from the average retirement account,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Wednesday on the Senate floor, hours before Trump’s reversal. The episode laid bare the rifts within Trump’s team of senior advisers as the White House struggled to offer a clear, consistent argument about the duration of the tariffs. While Bessent seemed open to negotiations, Peter Navarro, a senior trade adviser, appeared to take a more hard-line posture.  Elon Musk, the billionaire Tesla CEO who has been advising Trump on the government workforce, called Navarro “dumber than a sack of bricks,” while Navarro described Musk as someone who is merely “a car assembler, in many cases.” But the weeklong drama also underscored the peril of a policymaking process that is often tied to the wishes and vagaries of one man: Trump. Asked about the dust-up between Musk and Navarro, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a golf partner of Trump’s, said: “I don’t think it matters. The only one who matters is Trump.” Markets tend to favor predictability, as do business leaders deciding where to build new plants. When Trump sets a course, however, there are bound to be detours. A friend of his who spoke to him in recent days said Trump gave no sign he was about to “back down quickly on this stuff.” Trump believes other countries trade unfairly and sees tariffs as a tool to make the United States more competitive, the person said. “He’s very confident it’s going to work for him,” the person added, speaking on condition of anonymity. And yet in the run-up to Wednesday’s announcement, Trump and his aides were also hearing from GOP lawmakers and outside allies urging an alternative path. One was Larry Kudlow, who hosts a show on Fox Business Network and was a senior economic adviser in Trump’s first term. Kudlow told NBC News that he has had “ongoing” talks with friends in the West Wing about the need to negotiate with other countries before the United States slaps them with tariffs that stand in perpetuity. Describing Trump’s move Wednesday as “fabulous,” Kudlow added: “Dealmaking is the best thing to do. In the last 48 hours, Trump has gone from non-negotiating to negotiating. It’s very clear that Bessent is now the point man on trade. Very clear.” Anxious GOP lawmakers also weighed in. Graham said he spoke to Trump at length Tuesday night and told him he has been hearing from car manufacturers who are worried about how the tariffs would affect their business. BMW operates a plant in Graham’s home state and is one of the companies he said he has spoken to. Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., a lawmaker who was also in touch with the administration, said Tuesday that he planned to have lunch with Bessent. On Wednesday, he told NBC News he was also talking to the White House. Kennedy likened Trump to the “pit bull who caught the car.” Now, he said, the question becomes: “What are you going to do with the car?” After more market losses this week, and with pressure mounting from Republicans on Capitol Hill, Trump began having second thoughts. In his first term, he often viewed the ups and downs of the stock market as a kind of report card on his presidency, celebrating its rise. The downturn had gotten his attention. “People were getting a little queasy,” he acknowledged Wednesday at an event with NASCAR racing champions. ""Over the last few days,"" he began to more seriously consider pausing the additional tariffs, he told reporters later in the day in an Oval Office appearance. One prospect that intrigued him was personally negotiating new trade deals with the countries looking to get out from under the tariffs, the senior administration official said. He'd made up his mind. Sitting with Bessent and Lutnick, he crafted the note announcing the 90-day postponement and ending, for the time being, the biggest economic crisis of his young presidency. “We wrote it from our hearts, right?” Trump said. “It was written as something that I think was very positive for the world and for us, and we don’t want to hurt countries that don’t need to be hurt, and they all want to negotiate.” The day closed with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up nearly 8%, erasing some — but not all — of the post-“Liberation Day” losses. Messy as it all may have seemed, his administration insisted that all is unfolding as planned. ""You have been watching the greatest economic master strategy from an American President in history,"" White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller posted Wednesday afternoon.

212,"Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News  news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Gretchen Whitmer became governor after promising to “fix the damn roads” in Michigan.  Whether she goes any further depends on how well she can navigate some of the early bumps surfacing as she positions herself for a possible White House bid. On Wednesday, during a trip to Washington, D.C., that put a spotlight on her prospects in 2028, Whitmer hit what many of her fellow Democrats saw as two sizable potholes. First, in a policy speech outlining a “consistent national strategy,” Whitmer staked out common ground with President Donald Trump. And though Whitmer criticized Trump’s sweeping, roller-coaster rollout of — and subsequent retreat from — tariffs, she said she was not against tariffs “outright” and expressed understanding of Trump’s “motivation” behind deploying them. That drew a social media rebuke from Colorado’s Democratic governor, Jared Polis. “Tariffs are bad outright because they lead to higher prices and destroy American manufacturing,” Polis, another potential 2028 contender who has also sought ways to find common cause with Trump, wrote on X. “Trade is inherently good because both parties emerge better off from a consensual transaction.” Then, later Wednesday, Whitmer joined Trump in the Oval Office. She was scheduled to meet privately with him and discuss Michigan issues. That wasn’t how it ultimately played out.  Instead, she stood by as he signed several executive orders, including two calling for Justice Department probes of officials who served in his first administration and called him out for falsely claiming the 2020 election was stolen. He made the false claims about the election’s being “rigged” again Wednesday. Whitmer was invited into the Oval Office alongside Michigan state House Speaker Matt Hall, a Republican, as Trump held court with reporters and signed the executive orders. Photos showed Whitmer standing uncomfortably against a door as the cameras rolled. “She’s really done an excellent job,” Trump said of Whitmer during the impromptu media availability. “Very good person.” Though Trump did engage with her on issues she came to discuss, the fact that she was present at what amounted to a bipartisan photo opportunity as he took actions targeting political critics angered and confused allies. “Just a f---ing disaster,” said a Democratic operative who admires Whitmer and, like others interviewed for this article, was granted anonymity to share candid thoughts about her day. “It feels like it removes some of the momentum she had as a politically savvy swing-state Dem.” Whitmer’s team moved quickly to contain the fallout and counter mounting criticism from within her party. “The governor was surprised that she was brought into the Oval Office during President Trump’s press conference without any notice of the subject matter,” a Whitmer spokesperson said in a statement. “Her presence is not an endorsement of the actions taken or statements made at that event.” Democrats have long seen Whitmer as one of the party’s more formidable figures — a two-term governor of a battleground state who won re-election in a landslide and was nearly tapped to be Joe Biden’s running mate in 2020 after having considerably raised her public profile during the Covid pandemic. Whitmer is among a handful of prominent Democratic governors viewed as potential presidential contenders in 2028. But unlike some of her contemporaries, Whitmer has chosen to seek out a stronger working relationship with Trump in his second term. Trump won her state last fall, and Whitmer views herself as more of a center-left moderate with a middle-of-the-road, Midwestern constituency — one that is receptive to Trump’s message, including and especially on manufacturing and tariff policy.  In her Washington speech Wednesday, Whitmer called for cutting red tape and building more in the United States. She also railed against “partisanship,” saying it has seemingly “infected every aspect of our lives, and it’s exhausting.” “Let’s give more hard-working people a fair shot at a decent life,” she said. “And let’s usher in, as President Trump says, a ‘Golden Age’ of American manufacturing.” She did break with Trump on the more substantial tariffs he announced last week and partially paused later Wednesday afternoon, describing them as a “triple whammy: higher costs, fewer jobs and more uncertainty.” “I understand the motivation behind the tariffs, and I can tell you here’s where President Trump and I do agree,” she said. “We do need to make more stuff in America — more cars and chips, more steel and ships. We do need fair trade.” Her stance on tariffs puts her at odds with other potential Democratic presidential hopefuls, like Polis and Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, who offered sharp criticism of Trump’s “wrongheaded” measures in a speech in his state Wednesday. During a question-and-answer session with journalist Gretchen Carlson after her speech, Whitmer empathized with the many Democrats who don’t want Democratic officials to work with Trump. But she said she needs to be collaborative because “I took an oath to the people of Michigan to try to get as much done for the state.” Whitmer also said she hadn’t “thought through” how she’d handle tariffs differently from Trump, only that they should be used as a “scalpel.” A national Democratic strategist said, “It is a massive indictment on Whitmer and her team’s judgment to, first, not have an answer on the tariff question and then go the White House and get absolutely played by Donald Trump to the point she is caught in the Oval Office as he signs one of his revenge and retribution executive orders and says 2020 was rigged.”  About tariffs, her spokesperson emphasized areas of disagreement with Trump rather than ways the two overlap on the policy.  “This morning, the governor delivered a speech in Washington, D.C., about the devastating effects tariffs were having on Michiganders — from companies increasing prices and laying off workers to retirement accounts being wiped out,” Whitmer’s spokesperson said. “This afternoon, the 90-day pause was announced, and that is a step in the right direction and will provide relief to so many businesses across the state, but we remain concerned about tariffs that will hurt American auto companies.” Whitmer and Hall were supposed to discuss with Trump federal investment at Michigan’s Selfridge Air National Guard Base, a recent devastating ice storm in the state and a plan to deal with invasive Asian carp in Lake Michigan. Whitmer’s team and her allies described the meeting as a success on those matters. “Governor Whitmer thanks President Trump for his acknowledgements on protecting the Great Lakes from invasive carp, his work on Selfridge, and his openness to our request for help in northern Michigan,” her spokesperson said. A Democratic official who used to work with Whitmer said her dealings with Trump show she “is very good at advocating for her state.” “And President Trump clearly listens to what she says and what she does,” this person said. “You saw that today on tariffs, on the progress they made on Selfridge and on the other issues she brought to discuss.” Whitmer’s day also offered some political nuance. Her visit to the Oval Office didn’t annoy just Democrats. Republicans complained that it was an unnecessary boost to a leader they have long tried to demonize in a crucial electoral battleground. “Trump literally just f---ed Republicans in Michigan by saying Whitmer is doing an excellent job,” a Republican strategist from Michigan wrote in a text message. “I mean, WTF, she is running to replace him in 2028.” The budding Trump-Whitmer relationship — Wednesday’s meeting was their second in less than two months — would have been unthinkable not so long ago. Trump figured prominently in the political memoir Whitmer published last year, with a long-standing feud between them accounting for a large share of the first chapter: “Don’t Let the Bullies Get You Down.”  Whitmer wrote about how Trump responded to her criticism of his leadership during the early days of the pandemic by branding her dismissively and derisively as “that woman from Michigan.” Whitmer and her team embraced the insulting sobriquet, which became a staple in progressive merchandising. “That’s the secret to dealing with bullies: You take their weapon and make it your shield,” Whitmer wrote. “Every time Trump gave me a nickname, I made it my own.” That history had some observers struggling with cognitive dissonance Wednesday. “Whitmer hurt her candidacy today,” a Democratic strategist said. “She looked and sounded nervous in the Oval Office. That visual will stick. So will the image of Trump praising her as he signed executive orders targeting his critics.”  A second Democratic operative who has worked with Whitmer previously said her speech today felt like an “opening salvo” for a presidential bid. “There’s sort of this absolutism among Democrats where you’re either all against him or you’re not against him enough, right?” this person said. “And I think if you are a Midwestern governor, there are certainly appropriate times to be for tariffs.”  This person was surprised at the pushback she got from Polis after her address, adding that criticism showed “2028 is on.” But the person was also perplexed by Whitmer’s Oval Office appearance. “It overall seemed not great,” this person said. “The photo of her standing there in the corner looking uncomfortable. The odd banter. The whole thing didn’t make a lot of sense. Why did it happen? Whose idea was that?” Still, this person said Whitmer, who has pledged to work across the aisle, including with Trump, to deliver results for her state, can point to tangible results from her trip to Michiganders.  But nationally, the conversation around her visit will be very different. “Overall, hey, great visit, right?” this person continued, rattling off the local issues Whitmer went to discuss — before pivoting to the executive order spectacle. “It felt like, holy s---, what just happened?” Allan Smith is a political reporter for NBC News.

213,"Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News  news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time WASHINGTON — As President Donald Trump ramps up attacks on the judiciary, the Republican-led House voted Wednesday to limit district court judges’ ability to issue the nationwide injunctions that have hampered some of his executive actions.  The vote was 219-213, with just one Republican, Mike Turner of Ohio, joining all Democrats in opposing it. The bill now heads to the Senate, where it would almost certainly be blocked by a Democratic filibuster if it were brought to the floor. Trump and many of his allies on the far right had been pushing House Republicans to take a more extreme step and attempt to impeach judges that stood in his way. The ""No Rogue Rulings Act,"" authored by Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., doesn’t go that far, but it allows House Republicans to voice their support for Trump on the issue while avoiding politically perilous impeachment votes that would be all but doomed to fail. Follow live politics coverage here In a brief interview, Issa argued that both parties would benefit from the legislation. He said that during President Joe Biden's administration, Democrats howled when conservative judges issued nationwide injunctions against his executive actions.  ""This is a growing problem that has vexed both Republican and Democrat presidents,"" Issa, a senior member of the Judiciary Committee and the former chairman of the Oversight Committee, said before the vote. Biden, ""to the very end, was trying to get this process of activist judges exceeding their jurisdiction rolled back."" This bill, Issa said, ""limits judges to the original intent, which will allow them to make decisions but only as to the plaintiffs."" Trump and his allies have grown frustrated with lower-court judges’ issuing injunctions blocking Trump’s actions on deportations of undocumented immigrants, sweeping cuts and mass firings at federal agencies, ending birthright citizenship and other matters. Much of Republicans' criticism has centered on U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, who halted Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants alleged to be Tren de Aragua gang members.  After that decision, Rep. Brandon Gill, R-Texas, a Trump ally, introduced a resolution to impeach Boasberg, who is based in Washington, D.C. Other judges who have ruled against Trump also have faced impeachment threats, including U.S. District Judges Paul A. Engelmayer and John Bates. But GOP leaders have acknowledged such impeachment resolutions wouldn't have enough support to pass out of the House, where Republicans hold a narrow 220-213 majority.  On top of that, 67 votes would be needed for convictions in the Senate, where Republicans have a 53-47 majority. In some high-profile cases, the conservative-leaning Supreme Court has been ruling in Trump’s favor. On Monday, it tossed out Boasberg’s decision blocking the removal of the alleged gang members to El Salvador. A day later, the Supreme Court halted a ruling by U.S. District Judge William Alsup of California requiring some federal agencies to reinstate roughly 16,000 workers the Trump administration had tried to fire. Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, said his party in the past has tried to block ""judicial forum shopping,"" in which plaintiffs try to pick courts where they have higher chances of winning. ""But a nationwide injunction is a necessary part of the judicial tool kit,"" said Raskin, a former constitutional law professor. ""Why should every person affected [by an issue] have to go to court? Why should millions of people have to create their own case?""  ""Why should Brown vs. Board of Education have applied to just Linda Brown as opposed to everybody affected?"" he added.

214,"Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News  news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time As President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariff plans sent stocks tumbling and economists warning of a broader economic slowdown, many of Trump’s supporters say they support the move as part of a broader vision for the U.S. economy, even if prices rise. But a slice of 2024 Trump voters are deeply concerned, illustrating the real potential political peril for the president and his party. In interviews, 20 swing-state Trump voters who participated in last month’s national NBC News poll spoke about Trump and his tariffs after the president's policy announcement last week. Most are either fully on board with Trump’s vision — with many explicitly saying they are willing to live through short-term economic pain if it means achieving his vision of reordering the global economy to America’s benefit — or are cautiously optimistic that the tariffs will be effective negotiating tools. Veronica Rogers, a retiree in Georgia, was among those who said that Trump’s long-term goals of bringing back jobs to the United States outweigh her concerns about temporary higher prices. “Whether that’d be short term, or that’d be long term, I don’t know. I’m not an economist. But I do know that there’s billions and trillions of dollars that can be spent here to build industry to keep from paying tariffs. So, that sounds good to me,” she said. She was stunned that some people were taken aback by the scale of Trump’s tariffs, noting how frequently he talked about tariffs while campaigning. “Nothing they’re doing is news to people that voted for him,” Rogers, 63, said. Still, a handful of voters, including those who backed Trump in 2020 and 2024, warned that his tariff rollout threatens to squander one of his major campaign promises: to lower prices for Americans in the long term. The NBC News poll conducted in March, before Trump fully unveiled his tariff plans, found that a majority of Americans (55%) disapproved of his handling of inflation and the cost of living, while 54% disapproved of his handling of the economy overall. Members of the GOP were far more likely to give Trump passing marks on the economy than were independents and Democrats, but about 1 in 10 Republicans expressed displeasure with his handling of the key issues. “The track he’s on right now is just to piss the Democrats off, and I think it’s kind of working, but no, I’m not really too happy with the way things are going right now. He’s really gone off the wall,” said Cathy Phillips, a 64-year-old Pennsylvanian who voted for Trump in 2020 and 2024. “We’re scraping pennies together, I know how hard it is for us,” she continued. “I can’t imagine how hard it is for seniors who are even older than us. Something’s gotta give somewhere.” Yet, for many of these voters, Trump’s decision to put heavy tariffs on some of America’s biggest trading partners, such as the European Union, China and Vietnam, as well as most other countries, is exactly what they signed up for. “I feel like everything that I voted for has come to fruition already and more,” said Melanie Renaud, a 52-year-old dental hygienist from North Carolina. Some point to local factories that shuttered and moved jobs overseas, leaving behind crumbling communities, to argue for drastic steps to bring jobs back to the U.S. Others believe some of the sky-high tariff rates are a hard-edged negotiating tactic aimed at compelling countries to make immediate concessions that will help the American economy in the long term. Others said it’s a needed response to an economy they believe wasn’t working for them. “This trade war has to happen in order for fair trade to happen. And once fair trade is accomplished, I think prices will even back out,” said Reece Westfall, a 30-year-old Pennsylvania Republican.  “There’s a lot more to this than the price of everything,” Westfall continued, echoing recent arguments from Trump administration officials, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on NBC News’ “Meet the Press.” Donna J., 55, who declined to give her last name, said that while her part of North Carolina had a long history of textile mills like the one in which her grandfather worked, the town “basically folded in upon itself” once that factory closed. “What you get used to, sometimes, is the very thing that will kill you,” she said of how the globalized economy has hurt communities like hers. She said Americans need to “learn some patience and understand this is for the betterment of everyone,” calling the tariffs an example of Trump’s “promises made, promises kept.” But other voters who backed Trump were critical of the president’s approach. David, a Wisconsin man who voted for Trump in 2020 and 2024, said the administration is “throwing spaghetti at the wall to see what sticks.” (Like some others who were critical of Trump, he declined to share his last name because of concerns about retribution or harassment.) “I cannot see a reasonable businessperson in the near term looking at this and saying, ‘I feel confident that I can invest millions of dollars into a new production facility and create new jobs in the U.S.,” he said, later adding, “I was expecting a more reasoned and logical rollout.” David said he voted for Trump because of the economy, believing a continuation of Biden administration policies if Kamala Harris had won the election would not have been good for the country. But despite his hesitance about Trump’s economic policies, David said he would still vote for him if given a chance for a do-over, even if it was less than a full-throated support. “I would like to think that there would be a better option in the future,” he added. Another Trump voter, who declined to give his first or last name because of concerns about harassment or retaliation, said he now sees his vote for Trump as a “big mistake.” The 64-year-old Arizona man said his retirement savings have fallen 35% in recent weeks, and he may now have to delay his retirement. “It’s happened without any reasonable explanation,” he said “I don’t understand. I don’t understand how to declare a trade war on the world, how to betray the allies, I can’t understand it.” Many of the Trump voters who spoke to NBC News said they didn’t believe the high tariffs would last, instead predicting that they would compel other countries to the negotiating table. “I wouldn’t be surprised if, in the next month or two, we see a lot of these countries do bilateral negotiations,” said John, a 30-year-old from Arizona who voted for Trump in 2016 and 2024 but supported Joe Biden in 2020. “Part of these extremely high tariffs are designed, in a sense, in my belief, as a way to get more from these countries,” he continued. Ultimately, some of Trump’s most ardent supporters said they would be personally willing to take their lumps now, both in terms of potential rising prices and an unstable stock market, if it meant that the president's plans to reorient the global economy succeed, because they believe it will leave a better future for their children. “I’m willing to not look at my [401k] numbers on a daily basis. I’m willing to trust President Trump that it will turn around,” said Jodi L., a 62-year-old from Michigan. “I have to do my part. I can call up and complain all I want, but I believe it’s on the right path to turning this country around. I believe in him and what he’s said he would do because he’s proven himself in less than 100 days.” “I’m willing to take the knock if that’s what it takes for the long term.” Sherry Behr, a 67-year-old Republican from Pennsylvania, said, “I trust President Trump, that in six months, a year, we’ll start seeing a difference.”  Most Trump voters said they could not envision a scenario that would cause them to pull their support for him. But a few noted there might be a financial breaking point depending on how high prices go, and for how long. “If it goes like $100 for a pair of shoes, for stupid shoes, then we’re gonna have issues then,” said Nyssa, a 33-year-old stay-at-home mom in Pennsylvania, who said she backed Trump in hopes he would bring down grocery prices. “But a couple bucks here and there is not gonna really hurt anything.” And for a smaller few, the tariff debate has demonstrated that Trump isn’t following through on a key promise, either because of a perceived lack of attention or push to prioritize vengeance over solutions. David, the Wisconsin man, noted that Trump specifically criticized the Biden administration on high prices during the 2024 campaign. “And then shortly after coming into office, all sudden the tune changes, and it’s like, ‘Well, we’re going to see some prices go up,’” he said. Chelsea Linares, a 33-year-old insurance account manager in Georgia, told NBC News that Trump’s work on the economy has been a “slower start that I would say myself, and others, have anticipated,” noting prices are still high. While she’s still “optimistic,” she thinks “it’s going to get worse before it gets better.” “Even people that support Trump are probably going to be more pissed than they thought,” she said, adding that she still supported him. Blake, a three-time Trump voter from Arizona who is in his 30s, described himself as someone in “full ideological agreement” with the president on many issues. He said he would have scored Trump a 10/10 for his administration’s efforts in its first few days on issues including immigration and ending diversity, equity and inclusion programs. But he panned the tariff rollout as “lazy,” adding that the push could squander the full control of Washington that voters gave Republicans after the 2024 election. “I could be wrong, but I feel the cannonball way they came out with this is maximizing the pain without necessarily optimizing the speed we recover from it,” he said.

215,"Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News  news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time President Donald Trump and his billionaire adviser Elon Musk have fanned the flames of a baseless rumor about America’s gold reserves at least a dozen times since mid-February.  The conspiracy theory, alleging without evidence that someone might have stolen the gold reserves from Fort Knox, Kentucky, has circulated for decades, but it seems to have first appeared on the Trump administration’s radar after far-right financial blog Zero Hedge tagged Musk in a post about the idea on X.   Since then, Musk and Trump have shared the idea and teased plans for a personal inspection of the fortress that holds the government’s gold bars.  Despite raising alarm and fueling conspiracy chatter online and offline, there is no evidence that any gold is missing, and there’s no indication that Musk or Trump has taken any concrete steps toward visiting Fort Knox. A White House spokesperson declined to comment on their plans, saying in an email: “No announcements at this time.”   The rumor immediately found an audience, including gold obsessives who have nurtured conspiracy theories about government gold reserves for more than 50 years. Many of them stubbornly reject the evidence that Fort Knox is secure, and they interpret its security measures as evidence that the government is hiding something.  Aaron Klein, the chair of economic studies at the Brookings Institution, said the statements by Musk and Trump fit a pattern of the two men trying to sow doubt in traditional institutions.   “The gold has come to have a symbolic value of the faith in the U.S. government’s fundamental position,” said Klein, who served in the Obama Treasury Department.  “Questioning the gold as having been ‘lost’ or ‘stolen’ is part of a series of actions that undermine confidence in America,” he added. “Why somebody who purports to be trying to restore America would want to undermine its confidence is confusing.”  Trump and Musk are tapping into a classic but obscure rumor with a long history: People have recycled the claim that Fort Knox is empty on a semiregular basis, sometimes paired with vague anti-government vibes.   “It comes up periodically, and it has for decades,” said Philip Diehl, a former director of the U.S. Mint, which oversees the gold storage. “Eventually, the pressure builds, and the president sends somebody in to take a look.”  In 1974, after a gadfly author named Peter Beter charged that unnamed powerful interests had looted Fort Knox, the rumor spread so widely that the U.S. Mint decided to invite lawmakers and journalists for a tour. And in 2011, then-Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, who favored abolishing the Federal Reserve and returning to a gold-based currency system, held a congressional hearing on whether the Fort Knox gold was secure. Treasury officials from both Republican and Democratic administrations have repeatedly said the gold is fine, and in 2017, Trump’s treasury secretary at the time, Steven Mnuchin, visited the Kentucky fortress and came away satisfied.   “The gold was there when I visited it. I hope nobody’s moved it. I’m sure they haven’t,” Mnuchin, who isn’t serving in Trump’s second administration, told CNBC in February.  Trump’s current treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, told podcast host Dan O’Donnell in February: “All the gold is present and accounted for.”   No visit has materialized in the nearly two months since then, and it’s not clear why. Paul, the former congressman, said he’s not sure Musk and Trump will follow through. He has criticized Trump at times, including for bombing Yemen last month.   “They have other things to deal with. They have to plan the bombing in Yemen, and they have to deal with the oil in Syria. They have to stop a war on Ukraine, and so the gold they can forget about for a while. They’ll avoid it if they see an advantage to it. So that is why people don’t trust governments,” he said.  Paul said he believes past audits haven’t been thorough enough. He wants Trump and Musk to perform lab tests known as assays to determine the exact composition of the gold bars.  The gold reserve used to have a practical purpose: to allow foreign governments to swap their dollars for gold. But President Richard Nixon ended the practice in 1971. Now, its value is mainly symbolic of U.S. wealth, and other countries, such as China, have recently sought to build up their own reserves.  The gold theft rumors have come in several varieties, all without evidence, among them that European bankers took the gold or that the Rockefeller banking family did.  Certain conspiracy theories tend to pop up repeatedly over time, said Bret Schafer, a senior fellow who studies disinformation at the German Marshall Fund, a nonprofit organization that works to strengthen the U.S.-Europe alliance. Allegedly government-made bioweapons are one such recurring conspiracy theory, he said, and the Fort Knox gold rumor is another.   “These rumors work best when they’re built up over time. It’s like Hollywood sequels: You build off the original,” he said. And in both cases, he added, “you just get a lot of retreads.”  Fort Knox has appeared in movies that add to its allure. A scheme involving the facility is a major plot point in the 1964 James Bond film “Goldfinger,” underscoring the belief that Fort Knox could be a tempting target.   And unlike some internet-era hoaxes, the Fort Knox rumors originated in an age when conspiracy theories spread by less efficient means, not on X, whose owner, Musk, has 218 million listed followers.  “It precedes the social media digital age, but now we’re in an environment where things can pop from the corners of ‘conspiracy land’ to policy action in a matter of hours, because all of you have to do is land on Musk’s radar,” Schafer said.  Formally known as the U.S. Bullion Depository, the gold reserve site is next to the Army base Fort Knox. It was built in 1936, and President Franklin Roosevelt was the only visitor until the tour for media and members of Congress in 1974.  The tour 51 years ago yielded newspaper headlines such as one in The New York Times: “Visitors Get a Peek at Fort Knox Gold—It’s There.”  The Treasury Department’s nonpartisan inspector general audits the gold every year, said Eric Thorson, a former inspector general who’s now retired. He said that he sent teams of about three people every year and that he went personally once in 2011.   “There is absolutely zero doubt the gold is there,” he said.  “I’m a former Air Force pilot. I’ve been on bases with nuclear weapons, and this place has every bit the security that any nuclear base has,” he added. “The security is unbelievable. Nobody’s going to go in there and take it.”  Zero Hedge, a far-right financial blog and social media brand that appears to have first alerted Musk to the idea, frequently posts about gold as an investment. It tweeted in 2011 about Paul’s Fort Knox concerns and in 2017 about Mnuchin’s Fort Knox visit. Sometimes, accounts on X respond to Zero Hedge posts with commentary about Fort Knox.  Then, on Feb. 15, Zero Hedge posted a suggestion on X and tagged Musk directly.  “It would be great if @elonmusk could take a look inside Fort Knox just to make sure the 4,580 tons of US gold is there. Last time anyone looked was 50 years ago in 1974,” the account posted.  The second sentence is wrong, according to Thorson, but the post got the attention of Musk and others. It had 3.3 million views as of Friday.   “Surely it’s reviewed at least every year?” Musk responded to the post. Zero Hedge replied, repeating the falsehood that the gold isn’t reviewed every year.  Google Trends data shows that after the interaction, web searches for the term “Fort Knox” hit their highest level since Google began collecting data in 2004 and kept rising for several days.   On Feb. 16, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., Ron Paul’s son, chimed in. He repeated the inaccuracy that the gold isn’t reviewed annually and said, “Let’s do it.”  Zero Hedge has often faced restrictions on tech platforms for violating terms of service, including publishing allegedly derogatory material. In 2022, U.S. intelligence officials accused the site of amplifying Russian propaganda, a claim it denied. But under Musk’s ownership of X, Zero Hedge has thrived, growing its follower count from 1.5 million to 2.1 million.  Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones also discussed the Fort Knox rumor on his podcast. He said he supported Musk’s looking into Fort Knox while acknowledging that he heard the same rumor as a child more than 40 years ago. Jones’ sponsors and advertisers have for years included gold retailers.   Soon, Musk and Trump were fueling the uncertainty. On Feb. 17, Musk posted on X about the gold: “Maybe it’s there, maybe it’s not.” He spoke about it on Joe Rogan’s podcast and at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference, often mixing the conspiracy theory with attempts at humor.   “We want to go see it and just make sure somebody didn’t spray-paint some lead or something, you know?” Musk said at CPAC on Feb. 20.  Musk reiterated his intention to inspect the goal as recently as March 30 at a town hall-style event in Wisconsin, after an unidentified audience member raised the subject. “You were going to go check our gold, and I’m worried about the Democrats and Joe Biden’s last administration with the money not being there,” the audience member said.  “Did you get blocked? Or are you still able to check that?” he asked.  “That’s up to the president, of course, but I think it would be awesome to livestream Fort Knox,” Musk responded. “Hopefully it looks really cool.”  Trump mentioned it to reporters several times, including in the Oval Office on Feb. 24. He has a longtime fascination with gold, with a golden escalator at one of his New York towers and a chocolate bar wrapped in gold foil for sale on his website for $86.  “We’re actually going to Fort Knox to see if the gold is there, because maybe somebody stole the gold, tons of gold,” Trump said, without citing any evidence. The gold facility doesn’t offer tours, and its website is blunt: “No visitors are permitted in the facility.” But the Treasury Department answers to the president and would presumably let him in. The department didn’t respond to requests for comment.  The U.S. Mint says Fort Knox holds about 147.3 million ounces of gold currently, or about half the Treasury’s total gold reserves. That’s worth about $450 billion at the current market price — which is both a massive fortune and not enough to cover what the federal government spends in a single month.   Diehl, who was director of the U.S. Mint in the 1990s, said there’s a lot of overlap between Trump’s voting base and people who invest in metals such as gold or commemorative coins.  “Talking about gold speaks directly to his base,” said Diehl, who’s now the president of U.S. Money Reserve, a gold retailer.  Diehl said he’s certain the Fort Knox gold is secure, and yet he said he anticipates a surprise announcement of some kind by Trump, just given his approaching to governing: maybe selling the gold, maybe buying more, maybe something else entirely.  The price of gold soared to record highs in recent days amid concerns about Trump’s trade wars before they fell again along with other asset prices since last week’s tariff announcement. It’s unclear whether Musk or Trump has any personal gold holdings.  Thorson, the retired Treasury Department inspector general, said he believes the Fort Knox rumors are politically useful for Trump and Musk.  “What is probably happening here is taking any chance to make the American public feel that they’re being taken advantage of and that they’re a victim,” he said. Now, he said, Trump and Musk can position themselves as saviors in the mold of Trump’s 2016 statement “I alone can fix it.”   And the longer the visit doesn’t happen, the more useful the rumors become for anyone who benefits from them.  “If the intent is to undermine the financial system, you don’t actually want anyone to go there and look,” said Schafer, of the German Marshall Fund.  David Ingram is a tech reporter for NBC News. © 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"
222,"Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News  news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time A bipartisan team of freshman senators who went through some of 2024’s biggest battleground races is introducing a bill Wednesday to give President Donald Trump’s administration the power to stop investments from Chinese companies in the U.S. Sens. Bernie Moreno, R-Ohio; Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich.; and Tim Sheehy, R-Mont., are sponsoring the Providing Rigorous Oversight Through Evaluation of Concerning Transactions Act (or PROTECT Act), which would give the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States new authority to stop both entirely new foreign investment projects in the U.S. and foreign investments in existing facilities. The bill would “require the review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States of greenfield and brownfield investments by foreign countries of concern.” The legislation comes after the White House, in a February memo, asked for Congress to “strengthen” CFIUS’ ability to “restrict foreign adversary access to United States talent and operations in sensitive technologies (especially artificial intelligence).” In an interview, Moreno said Congress needs to give Trump “maximum negotiating leverage” to deal with China, and that this legislation contributes to that goal. ""We all went through extremely expensive, extremely tough races,"" Moreno said of the trio of senators introducing the legislation. ""And I think we’re probably the most in tune with what voters are thinking right now."" In a statement, Slotkin described the need for the legislation in national security terms, pointing to the importance of keeping “sensitive American land” out of Chinese, Iranian or North Korean control. “To address that risk, this bipartisan bill builds on my work in the U.S. House and gives more authority to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. to examine a broader set of transactions,” she said. “That means we can stop land purchases that pose an actual risk to our national security.” The senators introduced the legislation the same day Trump’s 104% total tariff on China went into effect — and he raised it to 125% later Wednesday. Meanwhile, China retaliated with a new 84% tariff on U.S. imports. Moreno promoted Trump’s actions and said the senators’ legislation is part of a broader effort to counter China, describing tariffs as “the beginning.” “You had 50 years where China was allowed into the World Trade Organization, they were given most favored nation trading status, and there was a very naive or corrupt, depending on which individual you’re talking about, view that this would be good for America,” Moreno said. “It has been catastrophically bad. We’ve now created a monster.” Last week, Bloomberg reported that China took steps to restrict Chinese companies from investing in the U.S. following Trump's tariff announcement, according to people familiar with the move. “Unfortunately, there’s a strategic adversary, and we have to reset that relationship in a meaningful way,” he continued, adding, “We don’t want to go to war with China, that’s not the goal here. But we have to stop being suckers, as President Trump talks about.” Trump’s global tariffs went into effect Wednesday, as some administration officials suggest there are deals to be made with trading partners while others have said nothing will change the direction of Trump’s tariff agenda. “Well that’s going to be up to President Trump, certainly,” Moreno said. “You hear from his public statements that he’s willing and open to listen to proposals. But obviously, China is a separate situation where we have over $1 trillion in debt.” Allan Smith is a political reporter for NBC News. © 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

The bill would “require the review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States of greenfield and brownfield investments by foreign countries of concern.” The legislation comes after the White House, in a February memo, asked for Congress to “strengthen” CFIUS’ ability to “restrict foreign adversary access to United States talent and operations in sensitive technologies (especially artificial intelligence).”

In an interview, Moreno said Congress needs to give Trump “maximum negotiating leverage” to deal with China, and that this legislation contributes to that goal.

""We all went through extremely expensive, extremely tough races,"" Moreno said of the trio of senators introducing the legislation. ""And I think we’re probably the most in tune with what voters are thinking right now.""

In a statement, Slotkin described the need for the legislation in national security terms, pointing to the importance of keeping “sensitive American land” out of Chinese, Iranian or North Korean control.

“To address that risk, this bipartisan bill builds on my work in the U.S. House and gives more authority to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. to examine a broader set of transactions,” she said. “That means we can stop land purchases that pose an actual risk to our national security.”

The senators introduced the legislation the same day Trump’s 104% total tariff on China went into effect — and he raised it to 125% later Wednesday. Meanwhile, China retaliated with a new 84% tariff on U.S. imports. Moreno promoted Trump’s actions and said the senators’ legislation is part of a broader effort to counter China, describing tariffs as “the beginning.”

“You had 50 years where China was allowed into the World Trade Organization, they were given most favored nation trading status, and there was a very naive or corrupt, depending on which individual you’re talking about, view that this would be good for America,” Moreno said. “It has been catastrophically bad. We’ve now created a monster.”

Last week, Bloomberg reported that China took steps to restrict Chinese companies from investing in the U.S. following Trump's tariff announcement, according to people familiar with the move.

“Unfortunately, there’s a strategic adversary, and we have to reset that relationship in a meaningful way,” he continued, adding, “We don’t want to go to war with China, that’s not the goal here. But we have to stop being suckers, as President Trump talks about.”

Trump’s global tariffs went into effect Wednesday, as some administration officials suggest there are deals to be made with trading partners while others have said nothing will change the direction of Trump’s tariff agenda.

“Well that’s going to be up to President Trump, certainly,” Moreno said. “You hear from his public statements that he’s willing and open to listen to proposals. But obviously, China is a separate situation where we have over $1 trillion in debt.”"
296,"Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News  news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time As President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariff plans sent stocks tumbling and economists warning of a broader economic slowdown, many of Trump’s supporters say they support the move as part of a broader vision for the U.S. economy, even if prices rise. But a slice of 2024 Trump voters are deeply concerned, illustrating the real potential political peril for the president and his party. In interviews, 20 swing-state Trump voters who participated in last month’s national NBC News poll spoke about Trump and his tariffs after the president's policy announcement last week. Most are either fully on board with Trump’s vision — with many explicitly saying they are willing to live through short-term economic pain if it means achieving his vision of reordering the global economy to America’s benefit — or are cautiously optimistic that the tariffs will be effective negotiating tools. Veronica Rogers, a retiree in Georgia, was among those who said that Trump’s long-term goals of bringing back jobs to the United States outweigh her concerns about temporary higher prices. “Whether that’d be short term, or that’d be long term, I don’t know. I’m not an economist. But I do know that there’s billions and trillions of dollars that can be spent here to build industry to keep from paying tariffs. So, that sounds good to me,” she said. She was stunned that some people were taken aback by the scale of Trump’s tariffs, noting how frequently he talked about tariffs while campaigning. “Nothing they’re doing is news to people that voted for him,” Rogers, 63, said. Still, a handful of voters, including those who backed Trump in 2020 and 2024, warned that his tariff rollout threatens to squander one of his major campaign promises: to lower prices for Americans in the long term. The NBC News poll conducted in March, before Trump fully unveiled his tariff plans, found that a majority of Americans (55%) disapproved of his handling of inflation and the cost of living, while 54% disapproved of his handling of the economy overall. Members of the GOP were far more likely to give Trump passing marks on the economy than were independents and Democrats, but about 1 in 10 Republicans expressed displeasure with his handling of the key issues. “The track he’s on right now is just to piss the Democrats off, and I think it’s kind of working, but no, I’m not really too happy with the way things are going right now. He’s really gone off the wall,” said Cathy Phillips, a 64-year-old Pennsylvanian who voted for Trump in 2020 and 2024. “We’re scraping pennies together, I know how hard it is for us,” she continued. “I can’t imagine how hard it is for seniors who are even older than us. Something’s gotta give somewhere.” Yet, for many of these voters, Trump’s decision to put heavy tariffs on some of America’s biggest trading partners, such as the European Union, China and Vietnam, as well as most other countries, is exactly what they signed up for. “I feel like everything that I voted for has come to fruition already and more,” said Melanie Renaud, a 52-year-old dental hygienist from North Carolina. Some point to local factories that shuttered and moved jobs overseas, leaving behind crumbling communities, to argue for drastic steps to bring jobs back to the U.S. Others believe some of the sky-high tariff rates are a hard-edged negotiating tactic aimed at compelling countries to make immediate concessions that will help the American economy in the long term. Others said it’s a needed response to an economy they believe wasn’t working for them. “This trade war has to happen in order for fair trade to happen. And once fair trade is accomplished, I think prices will even back out,” said Reece Westfall, a 30-year-old Pennsylvania Republican.  “There’s a lot more to this than the price of everything,” Westfall continued, echoing recent arguments from Trump administration officials, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on NBC News’ “Meet the Press.” Donna J., 55, who declined to give her last name, said that while her part of North Carolina had a long history of textile mills like the one in which her grandfather worked, the town “basically folded in upon itself” once that factory closed. “What you get used to, sometimes, is the very thing that will kill you,” she said of how the globalized economy has hurt communities like hers. She said Americans need to “learn some patience and understand this is for the betterment of everyone,” calling the tariffs an example of Trump’s “promises made, promises kept.” But other voters who backed Trump were critical of the president’s approach. David, a Wisconsin man who voted for Trump in 2020 and 2024, said the administration is “throwing spaghetti at the wall to see what sticks.” (Like some others who were critical of Trump, he declined to share his last name because of concerns about retribution or harassment.) “I cannot see a reasonable businessperson in the near term looking at this and saying, ‘I feel confident that I can invest millions of dollars into a new production facility and create new jobs in the U.S.,” he said, later adding, “I was expecting a more reasoned and logical rollout.” David said he voted for Trump because of the economy, believing a continuation of Biden administration policies if Kamala Harris had won the election would not have been good for the country. But despite his hesitance about Trump’s economic policies, David said he would still vote for him if given a chance for a do-over, even if it was less than a full-throated support. “I would like to think that there would be a better option in the future,” he added. Another Trump voter, who declined to give his first or last name because of concerns about harassment or retaliation, said he now sees his vote for Trump as a “big mistake.” The 64-year-old Arizona man said his retirement savings have fallen 35% in recent weeks, and he may now have to delay his retirement. “It’s happened without any reasonable explanation,” he said “I don’t understand. I don’t understand how to declare a trade war on the world, how to betray the allies, I can’t understand it.” Many of the Trump voters who spoke to NBC News said they didn’t believe the high tariffs would last, instead predicting that they would compel other countries to the negotiating table. “I wouldn’t be surprised if, in the next month or two, we see a lot of these countries do bilateral negotiations,” said John, a 30-year-old from Arizona who voted for Trump in 2016 and 2024 but supported Joe Biden in 2020. “Part of these extremely high tariffs are designed, in a sense, in my belief, as a way to get more from these countries,” he continued. Ultimately, some of Trump’s most ardent supporters said they would be personally willing to take their lumps now, both in terms of potential rising prices and an unstable stock market, if it meant that the president's plans to reorient the global economy succeed, because they believe it will leave a better future for their children. “I’m willing to not look at my [401k] numbers on a daily basis. I’m willing to trust President Trump that it will turn around,” said Jodi L., a 62-year-old from Michigan. “I have to do my part. I can call up and complain all I want, but I believe it’s on the right path to turning this country around. I believe in him and what he’s said he would do because he’s proven himself in less than 100 days.” “I’m willing to take the knock if that’s what it takes for the long term.” Sherry Behr, a 67-year-old Republican from Pennsylvania, said, “I trust President Trump, that in six months, a year, we’ll start seeing a difference.”  Most Trump voters said they could not envision a scenario that would cause them to pull their support for him. But a few noted there might be a financial breaking point depending on how high prices go, and for how long. “If it goes like $100 for a pair of shoes, for stupid shoes, then we’re gonna have issues then,” said Nyssa, a 33-year-old stay-at-home mom in Pennsylvania, who said she backed Trump in hopes he would bring down grocery prices. “But a couple bucks here and there is not gonna really hurt anything.” And for a smaller few, the tariff debate has demonstrated that Trump isn’t following through on a key promise, either because of a perceived lack of attention or push to prioritize vengeance over solutions. David, the Wisconsin man, noted that Trump specifically criticized the Biden administration on high prices during the 2024 campaign. “And then shortly after coming into office, all sudden the tune changes, and it’s like, ‘Well, we’re going to see some prices go up,’” he said. Chelsea Linares, a 33-year-old insurance account manager in Georgia, told NBC News that Trump’s work on the economy has been a “slower start that I would say myself, and others, have anticipated,” noting prices are still high. While she’s still “optimistic,” she thinks “it’s going to get worse before it gets better.” “Even people that support Trump are probably going to be more pissed than they thought,” she said, adding that she still supported him. Blake, a three-time Trump voter from Arizona who is in his 30s, described himself as someone in “full ideological agreement” with the president on many issues. He said he would have scored Trump a 10/10 for his administration’s efforts in its first few days on issues including immigration and ending diversity, equity and inclusion programs. But he panned the tariff rollout as “lazy,” adding that the push could squander the full control of Washington that voters gave Republicans after the 2024 election. “I could be wrong, but I feel the cannonball way they came out with this is maximizing the pain without necessarily optimizing the speed we recover from it,” he said.

In today’s edition, we dive into President Donald Trump’s sudden decision to pause many of his new tariffs. Plus, we explain why Texas is set to host one of the most intense contests of the 2026 midterms. And Andrea Mitchell previews the upcoming nuclear talks between the United States and Iran.  Sign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here. — Adam Wollner One week after his “Liberation Day,” President Donald Trump said he was pausing higher targeted tariffs for most countries for 90 days, a stunning reversal in his trade war that sent markets reeling.  In a social media post just before 1:30 p.m., Trump wrote that he came to the decision because more than 75 trading partners did not retaliate and have reached out to the United States to “discuss” some of the issues he had raised.   But the pause didn’t apply to China, which has retaliated with 84% hikes. Trump instead raised duties for it to 125%, effective immediately.    Zooming out: The trade war isn’t exactly over, and the pause didn’t return the world to the time before Trump touched off the global instability. A 10% across-the-board duty will remain — including for some products from Canada and Mexico.  The White House wouldn’t say which countries would be covered by the pause. Earlier Wednesday the European Union voted to impose fresh retaliatory duties, but they aren’t set to take effect until next week.  And separate tariffs on imported autos, steel and aluminum will remain, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said later — while planned tariffs on items like lumber and pharmaceuticals are still on.  How Wall Street responded: Markets soared on the surprising news Wednesday, with the S&P 500 climbing more than 9%, the tech-heavy Nasdaq closing up more than 12% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average ending nearly 3,000 points higher.   Goldman Sachs lowered its odds of a recession but said it is still forecasting minimal economic growth and a 45% probability of a recession given the remaining tariffs in place. What Trump said: Trump appeared to dig in on his tariff plan just hours earlier, telling Americans “BE COOL” on Truth Social. And he suggested not that long ago that the tariffs could be permanent.   “I thought that people were jumping a little bit out of line. They were getting yippie, you know, they were getting a little bit yippie, a little bit afraid,” he told reporters at the White House. “So we’ll see how it all works out. I think it’s going to work out amazing,” he added. Read more →  Related reads: Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton’s attempt to topple Republican Sen.

Cornyn is a fixture of the Republican Party in Texas, serving in its highest offices for more than 30 years and becoming a key voice on Capitol Hill. Paxton, the third-term attorney general who survived a bipartisan impeachment last year in part thanks to support from Trump and conservative activist allies, believes there’s an opening to cut him down from the right.   Now, both sides are aligning themselves with Trump amid the possibility of an endorsement that could tip the primary.

Leading the talks for Iran: Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, a veteran of nuclear negotiations. But so far, the two sides can’t even agree on the nature of the talks.  President Donald Trump told reporters they would be holding direct talks, which Iran has rejected since Trump withdrew in 2018 from the multinational Iran nuclear deal President Barack Obama’s secretary of state, John Kerry, negotiated three years earlier. Araghchi says they’ve agreed only to hold indirect talks, exchanging proposals through diplomatic go-betweens as they’d done with the Biden administration for two years, which went nowhere.  The stakes are serious: Iran has been processing nuclear fuel so rapidly it now has the ability to create one bomb within a week or two, according to the United Nations, former Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Trump administration warnings — though it would still take an estimated year or longer for Tehran to be able to create a warhead small enough for one of its ballistic missiles to carry.  Why are the talks so critical? Trump warned Monday that “it’s getting to be very dangerous territory, and hopefully those talks will be successful. And I think it would be in Iran’s best interests if they are successful.” Last month, he was more explicit, telling “Meet the Press” moderator Kristen Welker, “If they don’t make a deal, there will be bombing, and it will be bombing the likes of which they have never seen before.”  Multiple U.S. officials told NBC News that Iran is vulnerable to an attack: Israel’s retaliatory strike against Iran last fall eliminated many of Tehran’s air defenses. Israel has also killed the leader of Hezbollah, Iran’s proxy and front line of defense in neighboring Lebanon. Hamas’ leaders in Gaza, also Iran’s proxies, are gone. So is Tehran’s powerful ally in Syria, Bashar al-Assad. Trump has repeatedly signaled that he doesn’t want a war with Iran. To avoid one, the two sides have to at least agree, finally, to come face to face. That’s all From the Politics Desk for now. Today’s newsletter was compiled by Adam Wollner.

51,"A bipartisan team of freshman senators who went through some of 2024’s biggest battleground races is introducing a bill Wednesday to give President Donald Trump’s administration the power to stop investments from Chinese companies in the U.S.

Sens. Bernie Moreno, R-Ohio; Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich.; and Tim Sheehy, R-Mont., are sponsoring the Providing Rigorous Oversight Through Evaluation of Concerning Transactions Act (or PROTECT Act), which would give the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States new authority to stop both entirely new foreign investment projects in the U.S. and foreign investments in existing facilities.

The bill would “require the review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States of greenfield and brownfield investments by foreign countries of concern.” The legislation comes after the White House, in a February memo, asked for Congress to “strengthen” CFIUS’ ability to “restrict foreign adversary access to United States talent and operations in sensitive technologies (especially artificial intelligence).”

In an interview, Moreno said Congress needs to give Trump “maximum negotiating leverage” to deal with China, and that this legislation contributes to that goal.

""We all went through extremely expensive, extremely tough races,"" Moreno said of the trio of senators introducing the legislation. ""And I think we’re probably the most in tune with what voters are thinking right now.""

In a statement, Slotkin described the need for the legislation in national security terms, pointing to the importance of keeping “sensitive American land” out of Chinese, Iranian or North Korean control.

“To address that risk, this bipartisan bill builds on my work in the U.S. House and gives more authority to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. to examine a broader set of transactions,” she said. “That means we can stop land purchases that pose an actual risk to our national security.”

298,"Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News  news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time WASHINGTON — As President Donald Trump ramps up attacks on the judiciary, the Republican-led House voted Wednesday to limit district court judges’ ability to issue the nationwide injunctions that have hampered some of his executive actions.  The vote was 219-213, with just one Republican, Mike Turner of Ohio, joining all Democrats in opposing it. The bill now heads to the Senate, where it would almost certainly be blocked by a Democratic filibuster if it were brought to the floor. Trump and many of his allies on the far right had been pushing House Republicans to take a more extreme step and attempt to impeach judges that stood in his way. The ""No Rogue Rulings Act,"" authored by Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., doesn’t go that far, but it allows House Republicans to voice their support for Trump on the issue while avoiding politically perilous impeachment votes that would be all but doomed to fail. Follow live politics coverage here In a brief interview, Issa argued that both parties would benefit from the legislation. He said that during President Joe Biden's administration, Democrats howled when conservative judges issued nationwide injunctions against his executive actions.  ""This is a growing problem that has vexed both Republican and Democrat presidents,"" Issa, a senior member of the Judiciary Committee and the former chairman of the Oversight Committee, said before the vote. Biden, ""to the very end, was trying to get this process of activist judges exceeding their jurisdiction rolled back."" This bill, Issa said, ""limits judges to the original intent, which will allow them to make decisions but only as to the plaintiffs."" Trump and his allies have grown frustrated with lower-court judges’ issuing injunctions blocking Trump’s actions on deportations of undocumented immigrants, sweeping cuts and mass firings at federal agencies, ending birthright citizenship and other matters. Much of Republicans' criticism has centered on U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, who halted Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants alleged to be Tren de Aragua gang members.  After that decision, Rep. Brandon Gill, R-Texas, a Trump ally, introduced a resolution to impeach Boasberg, who is based in Washington, D.C. Other judges who have ruled against Trump also have faced impeachment threats, including U.S. District Judges Paul A. Engelmayer and John Bates. But GOP leaders have acknowledged such impeachment resolutions wouldn't have enough support to pass out of the House, where Republicans hold a narrow 220-213 majority.  On top of that, 67 votes would be needed for convictions in the Senate, where Republicans have a 53-47 majority. In some high-profile cases, the conservative-leaning Supreme Court has been ruling in Trump’s favor. On Monday, it tossed out Boasberg’s decision blocking the removal of the alleged gang members to El Salvador. A day later, the Supreme Court halted a ruling by U.S. District Judge William Alsup of California requiring some federal agencies to reinstate roughly 16,000 workers the Trump administration had tried to fire. Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, said his party in the past has tried to block ""judicial forum shopping,"" in which plaintiffs try to pick courts where they have higher chances of winning. ""But a nationwide injunction is a necessary part of the judicial tool kit,"" said Raskin, a former constitutional law professor. ""Why should every person affected [by an issue] have to go to court? Why should millions of people have to create their own case?""  ""Why should Brown vs. Board of Education have applied to just Linda Brown as opposed to everybody affected?"" he added.

300,"Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News  news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time WASHINGTON — “Liberation Day” just gave way to Capitulation Day. President Donald Trump pulled back Wednesday on a series of harsh tariffs targeting friends and foes alike in an audacious bid to remake the global economic order.  Trump's early afternoon announcement followed a harrowing week in which Republican lawmakers and confidants privately warned him that the tariffs could wreck the economy. His own aides had quietly raised alarms about the financial markets before he suspended a tariff regime that he had unveiled with a flourish just one week earlier in a Rose Garden ceremony. Follow live politics coverage here The stock market rose immediately after the about-face, ending days of losses that have forced older Americans who've been sinking their savings into 401(k)s to rethink their retirement plans. Ahead of Trump's announcement, some of his advisers had been in a near panic about the bond markets, according to a senior administration official. Interest rates on 10-year Treasury bonds had been rising, contrary to what normally happens when stock prices fall and investors seek safety in treasuries. The unusual dynamic meant that at the same time the tariffs could push up prices, people would be paying more to buy homes or pay off credit card debt because of higher interest rates. Businesses looking to expand would pay more for new loans. Two of Trump's most senior advisers, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, presented a united front Wednesday, urging him to suspend the tariffs in light of the bond market, the administration official said. In a social media post, Trump announced a 90-day pause that he said he’ll use to negotiate deals with dozens of countries that have expressed openness to revising trade terms that he contends exploit American businesses and workers. One exception is China. Trump upped the tariff on the country’s biggest geopolitical rival to 125%, part of a tit-for-tat escalation in an evolving trade war. Trump reversed course one week after he appeared in the Rose Garden and unveiled his plan to bring jobs back to the United States. Displaying a chart showing the new, elevated tariffs that countries would face, Trump proclaimed, “My fellow Americans, this is Liberation Day.” It proved short-lived. Markets plunged in anticipation of heightened trade wars, wiping out trillions of dollars in wealth. Democrats seized on the issue, looking to undercut a source of Trump’s popular appeal: the view that he can be trusted to steer the nation’s economy.  “Donald Trump’s market crash has vaporized a whopping $104,000 from the average retirement account,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Wednesday on the Senate floor, hours before Trump’s reversal. The episode laid bare the rifts within Trump’s team of senior advisers as the White House struggled to offer a clear, consistent argument about the duration of the tariffs. While Bessent seemed open to negotiations, Peter Navarro, a senior trade adviser, appeared to take a more hard-line posture.  Elon Musk, the billionaire Tesla CEO who has been advising Trump on the government workforce, called Navarro “dumber than a sack of bricks,” while Navarro described Musk as someone who is merely “a car assembler, in many cases.” But the weeklong drama also underscored the peril of a policymaking process that is often tied to the wishes and vagaries of one man: Trump. Asked about the dust-up between Musk and Navarro, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a golf partner of Trump’s, said: “I don’t think it matters. The only one who matters is Trump.” Markets tend to favor predictability, as do business leaders deciding where to build new plants. When Trump sets a course, however, there are bound to be detours. A friend of his who spoke to him in recent days said Trump gave no sign he was about to “back down quickly on this stuff.” Trump believes other countries trade unfairly and sees tariffs as a tool to make the United States more competitive, the person said. “He’s very confident it’s going to work for him,” the person added, speaking on condition of anonymity. And yet in the run-up to Wednesday’s announcement, Trump and his aides were also hearing from GOP lawmakers and outside allies urging an alternative path. One was Larry Kudlow, who hosts a show on Fox Business Network and was a senior economic adviser in Trump’s first term. Kudlow told NBC News that he has had “ongoing” talks with friends in the West Wing about the need to negotiate with other countries before the United States slaps them with tariffs that stand in perpetuity. Describing Trump’s move Wednesday as “fabulous,” Kudlow added: “Dealmaking is the best thing to do. In the last 48 hours, Trump has gone from non-negotiating to negotiating. It’s very clear that Bessent is now the point man on trade. Very clear.” Anxious GOP lawmakers also weighed in. Graham said he spoke to Trump at length Tuesday night and told him he has been hearing from car manufacturers who are worried about how the tariffs would affect their business. BMW operates a plant in Graham’s home state and is one of the companies he said he has spoken to. Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., a lawmaker who was also in touch with the administration, said Tuesday that he planned to have lunch with Bessent. On Wednesday, he told NBC News he was also talking to the White House. Kennedy likened Trump to the “pit bull who caught the car.” Now, he said, the question becomes: “What are you going to do with the car?” After more market losses this week, and with pressure mounting from Republicans on Capitol Hill, Trump began having second thoughts. In his first term, he often viewed the ups and downs of the stock market as a kind of report card on his presidency, celebrating its rise. The downturn had gotten his attention. “People were getting a little queasy,” he acknowledged Wednesday at an event with NASCAR racing champions. ""Over the last few days,"" he began to more seriously consider pausing the additional tariffs, he told reporters later in the day in an Oval Office appearance. One prospect that intrigued him was personally negotiating new trade deals with the countries looking to get out from under the tariffs, the senior administration official said. He'd made up his mind. Sitting with Bessent and Lutnick, he crafted the note announcing the 90-day postponement and ending, for the time being, the biggest economic crisis of his young presidency. “We wrote it from our hearts, right?” Trump said. “It was written as something that I think was very positive for the world and for us, and we don’t want to hurt countries that don’t need to be hurt, and they all want to negotiate.” The day closed with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up nearly 8%, erasing some — but not all — of the post-“Liberation Day” losses. Messy as it all may have seemed, his administration insisted that all is unfolding as planned. ""You have been watching the greatest economic master strategy from an American President in history,"" White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller posted Wednesday afternoon.

299,"Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News  news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Gretchen Whitmer became governor after promising to “fix the damn roads” in Michigan.  Whether she goes any further depends on how well she can navigate some of the early bumps surfacing as she positions herself for a possible White House bid. On Wednesday, during a trip to Washington, D.C., that put a spotlight on her prospects in 2028, Whitmer hit what many of her fellow Democrats saw as two sizable potholes. First, in a policy speech outlining a “consistent national strategy,” Whitmer staked out common ground with President Donald Trump. And though Whitmer criticized Trump’s sweeping, roller-coaster rollout of — and subsequent retreat from — tariffs, she said she was not against tariffs “outright” and expressed understanding of Trump’s “motivation” behind deploying them. That drew a social media rebuke from Colorado’s Democratic governor, Jared Polis. “Tariffs are bad outright because they lead to higher prices and destroy American manufacturing,” Polis, another potential 2028 contender who has also sought ways to find common cause with Trump, wrote on X. “Trade is inherently good because both parties emerge better off from a consensual transaction.” Then, later Wednesday, Whitmer joined Trump in the Oval Office. She was scheduled to meet privately with him and discuss Michigan issues. That wasn’t how it ultimately played out.  Instead, she stood by as he signed several executive orders, including two calling for Justice Department probes of officials who served in his first administration and called him out for falsely claiming the 2020 election was stolen. He made the false claims about the election’s being “rigged” again Wednesday. Whitmer was invited into the Oval Office alongside Michigan state House Speaker Matt Hall, a Republican, as Trump held court with reporters and signed the executive orders. Photos showed Whitmer standing uncomfortably against a door as the cameras rolled. “She’s really done an excellent job,” Trump said of Whitmer during the impromptu media availability. “Very good person.” Though Trump did engage with her on issues she came to discuss, the fact that she was present at what amounted to a bipartisan photo opportunity as he took actions targeting political critics angered and confused allies. “Just a f---ing disaster,” said a Democratic operative who admires Whitmer and, like others interviewed for this article, was granted anonymity to share candid thoughts about her day. “It feels like it removes some of the momentum she had as a politically savvy swing-state Dem.” Whitmer’s team moved quickly to contain the fallout and counter mounting criticism from within her party. “The governor was surprised that she was brought into the Oval Office during President Trump’s press conference without any notice of the subject matter,” a Whitmer spokesperson said in a statement. “Her presence is not an endorsement of the actions taken or statements made at that event.” Democrats have long seen Whitmer as one of the party’s more formidable figures — a two-term governor of a battleground state who won re-election in a landslide and was nearly tapped to be Joe Biden’s running mate in 2020 after having considerably raised her public profile during the Covid pandemic. Whitmer is among a handful of prominent Democratic governors viewed as potential presidential contenders in 2028. But unlike some of her contemporaries, Whitmer has chosen to seek out a stronger working relationship with Trump in his second term. Trump won her state last fall, and Whitmer views herself as more of a center-left moderate with a middle-of-the-road, Midwestern constituency — one that is receptive to Trump’s message, including and especially on manufacturing and tariff policy.  In her Washington speech Wednesday, Whitmer called for cutting red tape and building more in the United States. She also railed against “partisanship,” saying it has seemingly “infected every aspect of our lives, and it’s exhausting.” “Let’s give more hard-working people a fair shot at a decent life,” she said. “And let’s usher in, as President Trump says, a ‘Golden Age’ of American manufacturing.” She did break with Trump on the more substantial tariffs he announced last week and partially paused later Wednesday afternoon, describing them as a “triple whammy: higher costs, fewer jobs and more uncertainty.” “I understand the motivation behind the tariffs, and I can tell you here’s where President Trump and I do agree,” she said. “We do need to make more stuff in America — more cars and chips, more steel and ships. We do need fair trade.” Her stance on tariffs puts her at odds with other potential Democratic presidential hopefuls, like Polis and Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, who offered sharp criticism of Trump’s “wrongheaded” measures in a speech in his state Wednesday. During a question-and-answer session with journalist Gretchen Carlson after her speech, Whitmer empathized with the many Democrats who don’t want Democratic officials to work with Trump. But she said she needs to be collaborative because “I took an oath to the people of Michigan to try to get as much done for the state.” Whitmer also said she hadn’t “thought through” how she’d handle tariffs differently from Trump, only that they should be used as a “scalpel.” A national Democratic strategist said, “It is a massive indictment on Whitmer and her team’s judgment to, first, not have an answer on the tariff question and then go the White House and get absolutely played by Donald Trump to the point she is caught in the Oval Office as he signs one of his revenge and retribution executive orders and says 2020 was rigged.”  About tariffs, her spokesperson emphasized areas of disagreement with Trump rather than ways the two overlap on the policy.  “This morning, the governor delivered a speech in Washington, D.C., about the devastating effects tariffs were having on Michiganders — from companies increasing prices and laying off workers to retirement accounts being wiped out,” Whitmer’s spokesperson said. “This afternoon, the 90-day pause was announced, and that is a step in the right direction and will provide relief to so many businesses across the state, but we remain concerned about tariffs that will hurt American auto companies.” Whitmer and Hall were supposed to discuss with Trump federal investment at Michigan’s Selfridge Air National Guard Base, a recent devastating ice storm in the state and a plan to deal with invasive Asian carp in Lake Michigan. Whitmer’s team and her allies described the meeting as a success on those matters. “Governor Whitmer thanks President Trump for his acknowledgements on protecting the Great Lakes from invasive carp, his work on Selfridge, and his openness to our request for help in northern Michigan,” her spokesperson said. A Democratic official who used to work with Whitmer said her dealings with Trump show she “is very good at advocating for her state.” “And President Trump clearly listens to what she says and what she does,” this person said. “You saw that today on tariffs, on the progress they made on Selfridge and on the other issues she brought to discuss.” Whitmer’s day also offered some political nuance. Her visit to the Oval Office didn’t annoy just Democrats. Republicans complained that it was an unnecessary boost to a leader they have long tried to demonize in a crucial electoral battleground. “Trump literally just f---ed Republicans in Michigan by saying Whitmer is doing an excellent job,” a Republican strategist from Michigan wrote in a text message. “I mean, WTF, she is running to replace him in 2028.” The budding Trump-Whitmer relationship — Wednesday’s meeting was their second in less than two months — would have been unthinkable not so long ago. Trump figured prominently in the political memoir Whitmer published last year, with a long-standing feud between them accounting for a large share of the first chapter: “Don’t Let the Bullies Get You Down.”  Whitmer wrote about how Trump responded to her criticism of his leadership during the early days of the pandemic by branding her dismissively and derisively as “that woman from Michigan.” Whitmer and her team embraced the insulting sobriquet, which became a staple in progressive merchandising. “That’s the secret to dealing with bullies: You take their weapon and make it your shield,” Whitmer wrote. “Every time Trump gave me a nickname, I made it my own.” That history had some observers struggling with cognitive dissonance Wednesday. “Whitmer hurt her candidacy today,” a Democratic strategist said. “She looked and sounded nervous in the Oval Office. That visual will stick. So will the image of Trump praising her as he signed executive orders targeting his critics.”  A second Democratic operative who has worked with Whitmer previously said her speech today felt like an “opening salvo” for a presidential bid. “There’s sort of this absolutism among Democrats where you’re either all against him or you’re not against him enough, right?” this person said. “And I think if you are a Midwestern governor, there are certainly appropriate times to be for tariffs.”  This person was surprised at the pushback she got from Polis after her address, adding that criticism showed “2028 is on.” But the person was also perplexed by Whitmer’s Oval Office appearance. “It overall seemed not great,” this person said. “The photo of her standing there in the corner looking uncomfortable. The odd banter. The whole thing didn’t make a lot of sense. Why did it happen? Whose idea was that?” Still, this person said Whitmer, who has pledged to work across the aisle, including with Trump, to deliver results for her state, can point to tangible results from her trip to Michiganders.  But nationally, the conversation around her visit will be very different. “Overall, hey, great visit, right?” this person continued, rattling off the local issues Whitmer went to discuss — before pivoting to the executive order spectacle. “It felt like, holy s---, what just happened?” Allan Smith is a political reporter for NBC News.

301,"Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News  news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time President Donald Trump said Wednesday he was pausing higher targeted tariffs for 90 days for most countries, a stunning reversal in his trade war that has sent markets reeling.   Trump wrote on social media just before 1:30 p.m. that he came to the decision because more than 75 trading partners didn’t retaliate and have reached out to the United States to “discuss” some of the issues he had raised.    The pause didn’t apply to China, which has retaliated — with 84% hikes. Trump instead raised duties for it to 125%, effective immediately.    “Based on the lack of respect that China has shown to the World’s Markets, I am hereby raising the Tariff charged to China by the United States of America to 125%, effective immediately,” he wrote. “At some point, hopefully in the near future, China will realize that the days of ripping off the U.S.A., and other Countries, is no longer sustainable or acceptable.”  But the trade war isn’t exactly over, and the pause didn’t return the world to the time before Trump touched off the global instability; a 10% across-the-board duty will remain. For Canada and Mexico, goods covered by the U.S., Canada and Mexico trade agreement will continue to have no tariffs, while products that aren't exempt under the trade deal will have a 25% tariff. Canadian energy and fertilizer products will have a 10% tariff. It wasn’t immediately clear which countries the pause would cover; the White House wouldn’t say. Earlier Wednesday, the European Union voted to impose fresh retaliatory duties, but they aren’t set to take effect until next week.   And separate tariffs on imported autos, steel and aluminum will remain, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said later — while planned tariffs on items like lumber and pharmaceuticals are still on.  It’s not clear what prompted Trump to change his mind — he appeared to dig in just hours earlier, telling Americans “BE COOL” in a Truth Social post, and he suggested not that long ago that the tariffs could be permanent.   “I did a 90-day pause for the people that didn’t retaliate, because I told them, ‘If you retaliate, we’re going to double it,’” Trump said Wednesday. “And that’s what I did with China, because they did retaliate. So we’ll see how it all works out. I think it’s going to work out amazing.”  But markets have been in stunning turmoil — major stock indexes shed trillions of dollars in value, while alarming signals from the bond market set Wall Street on edge.   When a false-at-the-time headline suggesting Trump would take a 90-day pause shot around the internet Monday, markets briefly surged. And a growing chorus of business leaders and Trump’s allies have come out publicly against the tariffs, including Tesla CEO Elon Musk.  Markets soared on the surprising news Wednesday, with the S&P 500 climbing more than 9%, the tech-heavy Nasdaq closing up more than 12% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average ending nearly 3,000 points higher. Among the big gainers: Tesla stock was up 22%. Despite the gains, all three indexes were down from where they were a month ago and at the start of the year, and some investors questioned what the recent volatility could mean for the U.S. stock market longer-term. ""My portfolio of defensive stocks is green so I don’t begrudge today’s market. But I ask you, would you want to own highly volatile US stocks whose price depends on whether POTUS had a good night’s sleep and woke up the next morning to reverse yesterday’s policies?"" billionaire investor Bill Gross said on X. Goldman Sachs lowered its odds of a recession but said it is still forecasting minimal economic growth and a 45% probability of a recession given the remaining tariffs. Borrowing costs — which had surged early Wednesday as the tariffs took effect — also eased slightly, though not substantially, as some investors may fear a lingering fallout.   Trump has been talking about tariffs as the solution for U.S. economic problems since before he became president; he branded April 2 — when he unveiled the plan — “Liberation Day,” saying it would end decades of the country’s being “looted, pillaged, raped and plundered” by other countries.  The global markets recoiled, and last week $6.6 trillion alone was wiped out. Yet Trump and his allies had doubled down until Wednesday, arguing tariffs were necessary to return manufacturing to the United States and fill the nation’s coffers with trillions of dollars in revenue that could be used to pay down debt or offset tax cuts.   It’s not clear how the White House expects the policies to fuel big gains now. With the lower 10% tariff rate left in place, there will be less incentive for companies to relocate production to the United States and less revenue being generated.  After the news, Bessent sought to make the about-face into a negotiating tactic, insisting it was a way to scare countries to come to the negotiating table by demonstrating how high the United States was going to go.    “President Trump created maximum negotiating leverage for himself,” he said.   It’s unclear how successful the United States will be at negotiating new trade agreements with other countries given Trump’s on-again, off-again threats over the past several months. Previously, he had threatened sweeping tariffs on all imports from Mexico and Canada before he walked most of them back.   And while markets surged higher Wednesday following Trump’s pause, economic uncertainty remains over what will come next in the U.S. trade war with China, which exports more than $400 billion worth of goods to the United States each year.   Under Trump’s new tariffs, the cost for U.S. companies importing goods from China has more than doubled. Those products include everything from toys and sneakers to televisions and iPhones.   U.S. companies exporting their products to China are also caught up in the fray after China increased its tariffs on American goods like agriculture products and machinery. But the White House is downplaying that risk.   “What I am certain of is that what China is doing will affect their economy much more than ours because they have an export-driven, flood-the-world-with-cheap-exports model,” Bessent said.  Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said on X that he sat with Trump as he posted the initial message, adding: “The world is ready to work with President Trump to fix global trade, and China has chosen the opposite direction.”  The Trump administration will now face the daunting task of trying to negotiate dozens of potentially complex and intricate trade deals in a three-month period.  ""That is a huge task to negotiate simultaneously with that many trading partners over that many issues,” said Greta Peisch, who was general counsel for the U.S. trade representative’s office during the Biden administration. “We have tariffs, non-tariff barriers, other non-trade related matters, all of those issues can get quite complicated quite quickly. Even with just a handful of trading partners, that would be a large undertaking."" Rob Wile is a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist covering breaking business stories for NBCNews.com.

303,"Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News  news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time A bipartisan team of freshman senators who went through some of 2024’s biggest battleground races is introducing a bill Wednesday to give President Donald Trump’s administration the power to stop investments from Chinese companies in the U.S. Sens. Bernie Moreno, R-Ohio; Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich.; and Tim Sheehy, R-Mont., are sponsoring the Providing Rigorous Oversight Through Evaluation of Concerning Transactions Act (or PROTECT Act), which would give the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States new authority to stop both entirely new foreign investment projects in the U.S. and foreign investments in existing facilities. The bill would “require the review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States of greenfield and brownfield investments by foreign countries of concern.” The legislation comes after the White House, in a February memo, asked for Congress to “strengthen” CFIUS’ ability to “restrict foreign adversary access to United States talent and operations in sensitive technologies (especially artificial intelligence).” In an interview, Moreno said Congress needs to give Trump “maximum negotiating leverage” to deal with China, and that this legislation contributes to that goal. ""We all went through extremely expensive, extremely tough races,"" Moreno said of the trio of senators introducing the legislation. ""And I think we’re probably the most in tune with what voters are thinking right now."" In a statement, Slotkin described the need for the legislation in national security terms, pointing to the importance of keeping “sensitive American land” out of Chinese, Iranian or North Korean control. “To address that risk, this bipartisan bill builds on my work in the U.S. House and gives more authority to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. to examine a broader set of transactions,” she said. “That means we can stop land purchases that pose an actual risk to our national security.” The senators introduced the legislation the same day Trump’s 104% total tariff on China went into effect — and he raised it to 125% later Wednesday. Meanwhile, China retaliated with a new 84% tariff on U.S. imports. Moreno promoted Trump’s actions and said the senators’ legislation is part of a broader effort to counter China, describing tariffs as “the beginning.” “You had 50 years where China was allowed into the World Trade Organization, they were given most favored nation trading status, and there was a very naive or corrupt, depending on which individual you’re talking about, view that this would be good for America,” Moreno said. “It has been catastrophically bad. We’ve now created a monster.” Last week, Bloomberg reported that China took steps to restrict Chinese companies from investing in the U.S. following Trump's tariff announcement, according to people familiar with the move. “Unfortunately, there’s a strategic adversary, and we have to reset that relationship in a meaningful way,” he continued, adding, “We don’t want to go to war with China, that’s not the goal here. But we have to stop being suckers, as President Trump talks about.” Trump’s global tariffs went into effect Wednesday, as some administration officials suggest there are deals to be made with trading partners while others have said nothing will change the direction of Trump’s tariff agenda. “Well that’s going to be up to President Trump, certainly,” Moreno said. “You hear from his public statements that he’s willing and open to listen to proposals. But obviously, China is a separate situation where we have over $1 trillion in debt.” Allan Smith is a political reporter for NBC News. © 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"
302,"Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News  news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time HONG KONG — The increasingly vicious trade war between Washington and Beijing took another turn Wednesday when China imposed an additional 50% tariff on imports from the U.S., hiking its levies on American imports to 84%. The tit-for-tat escalation came hours after President Donald Trump’s 104% tariffs on Chinese imports went into effect, including 50% Trump added Monday. Later Wednesday, Trump increased the overall U.S. tariff on Chinese goods to 125%, even as he paused higher targeted tariffs on other countries for 90 days while keeping a 10% baseline tariff in place for all countries. Trump’s 50% tariff is a “mistake upon another mistake,” China’s Customs Tariff Commission said in a statement earlier Wednesday, adding that the world’s two biggest economies should “resolve differences through equal dialogue based on mutual respect.”  The effect of China’s 84% tariff may be somewhat limited because China imports only about $160 billion a year in U.S. goods compared with the more than $400 billion in goods it exports to the U.S. “I don’t think they can match in the economic realm, because the relationship is so unbalanced,” said Rick Waters, the Singapore-based director of the Carnegie China think tank. “So what they tend to do is move into adjacent realms to exact a price.”  Here's a look at some of the other measures China might take.  China could greatly increase tariffs on U.S. agricultural products, or even stop importing them completely. “I think there’s a very high chance that China will stop agricultural imports from the U.S. altogether,” said Tianchen Xu, a Beijing-based economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit, a financial forecasting service. “It’s a weapon targeting Trump’s supporter base,” he added.  Soybeans, which are crushed to make protein-rich animal feed ingredients and vegetable oils, have been at the heart of the U.S.-China trade dispute for some time. U.S. exports of soybeans to China fell 75% after China imposed a retaliatory 25% tariff on them in 2018, during Trump’s first-term trade war with Beijing. The Trump administration announced $12 billion in subsidies for farmers to offset the impact, and it has again promised to step in if the latest round of tariffs hurts the industry further. China could also put further restrictions on American poultry products, having announced an import ban on two U.S. companies last week. China, which frequently trades places with North America as the world’s largest box office, is a crucial market for Hollywood films. Though China has an annual quota for the number of foreign movies that can appear in its theaters, it could ban Hollywood films altogether. American movies have already been declining in popularity in recent years as U.S.-China trade tensions have escalated. There were no Hollywood films among China’s 10 highest-grossing movies in 2023, in stark contrast to 2012, when seven of the top 10 highest-grossing movies were U.S.-made, according to Maoyan, a Chinese movie-ticketing and data platform.  The U.S. has a large trade deficit with China in goods, but it comes out ahead when it comes to services such as finance, consulting and law. U.S. data lists China as its fifth-largest export market for services, according to a report by China’s State Council released Wednesday. China could target the U.S. services sector, for example, by excluding American companies from government procurement processes or restricting their cooperation with Chinese firms. The U.S. has long accused China of stealing its intellectual property. But Beijing also has its own growing intellectual property interests, and it could investigate U.S. companies in China in an effort to protect them. China and the U.S. have made progress on stemming the international flow of precursor ingredients for fentanyl, some of which originate in China and are then processed into the deadly opioid in countries such as Mexico before being smuggled into the U.S.  But China could bring that cooperation to a halt in response to Trump’s tariffs. “Out of humanitarian considerations, China has provided various forms of assistance to the U.S.,” Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said last month. “The U.S. should not repay goodwill with hostility.” Waters said it would be “counterproductive” for China to suspend cooperation on fentanyl. “It’s just going to cement narratives in the U.S. that they’re weaponizing drugs against us,” he said.

304,"Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News  news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton’s attempt to topple Republican Sen. John Cornyn in a Senate primary next year kicks off one of the most intense contests of the 2026 elections — a GOP-versus-GOP battle between two men who have been sparring for years and vying for President Donald Trump’s attention.   Cornyn is a fixture of the Republican Party in Texas, serving in its highest offices for more than 30 years and becoming a key voice on Capitol Hill. Paxton, the third-term attorney general who survived a bipartisan impeachment last year in part thanks to support from Trump and conservative activist allies, believes there’s an opening to cut the incumbent down from the right.  Now, both sides are aligning themselves with Trump amid the possibility of an endorsement that could tip the primary.  Whether one comes or not, one thing is clear. “This is gonna be the nastiest race in the modern era of Texas politics, period,” former Travis County GOP chairman Matt Mackowiak said.   Paxton immediately attacked Cornyn for having “turned his back on President Trump,” pointing to comments Cornyn made in 2023 about Trump’s indictment over his handling of classified documents, as well as the senator’s comments that he didn’t think Trump “could win the presidency” after Trump was found liable for sexual abuse in a civil case that same year. Paxton has also targeted Cornyn over his votes on issues including guns and immigration to try to argue that he is more aligned with conservative values. “While John was criticizing Trump and suggesting he shouldn’t run, I was at Mar-a-Lago” for Trump’s presidential announcement speech, Paxton told “The Mark Davis Show” in Dallas.   ""If he had the record of [Texas GOP Sen.] Ted Cruz, would I be here? Absolutely not,"" Paxton continued. ""This isn’t about what he’s saying and the love he suddenly has for President Trump and the love he has for all of our issues now. This isn’t about that love. I don’t believe that love, I believe in action."" Cornyn, though, also made an appeal to Trump’s interests, telling reporters at the Capitol on Wednesday that Paxton’s Senate bid is a “con man’s vanity project.”   “The biggest potential loser is President Trump’s agenda,” Cornyn said of the primary challenge.  “Mr. Paxton has a checkered background, he is a con man and a fraud, and I think the people of Texas know that, but this is what will be litigated during the course of this campaign. I am not going to turn over the Senate seat that was once held by Sam Houston to someone like him,” he added, a reference to the 2023 impeachment trial of Paxton, after which he survived a conviction vote in the state Senate.    “It’s unclear to me exactly what is motivating Mr. Paxton other than vanity and personal ambition,” Cornyn continued.  In the months before Paxton jumped in — and in the hours since — Cornyn has made clear he’s hugging Trump as tight as he can. He posted on X a photo of him reading Trump’s “The Art of the Deal” and called it “recommended” reading; he took to the Senate floor to defend Trump aide and billionaire Elon Musk (whose businesses have a significant footprint in Texas) after protests at Tesla dealerships; and he has been framing himself as one of Trump’s top allies in the Senate.   The roots of this clash between another establishment-insurgent pair of Republicans run deep, part of a decade-plus battle within the Texas GOP that has ousted legislative leaders, fueled Cruz's rise, fanned the flames of Paxton’s impeachment, and led to proxy wars up and down the ballot.   Paxton had been telegraphing a run against Cornyn from the right for more than a year. In early 2024, Paxton lambasted the senator as “anti-Trump [and] anti-gun” in a post on X, adding that “Texans deserve another conservative Senator.”   Cornyn reposted the message and replied: “Hard to run from prison, Ken,” a reference to the investigations that led to the impeachment trial. (The Associated Press reported this month that the Justice Department decided last year not to prosecute Paxton over corruption allegations.)  Brendan Steinhauser, a longtime GOP consultant who served as Cornyn’s campaign manager in the past but is unaffiliated in this race, told NBC News it’s no surprise to see Cornyn campaign with an eye on Trump.   “If you’re Senator Cornyn, you’re going to be campaigning on all the ways that you have supported and worked with the president, you’re going to talk about all the policies where you align, you’re going to talk about helping to get all of his judicial nominees through,” he said.  While a potential endorsement from Trump remains a major question, Cornyn does have support from Senate Republicans. Sen. Tim Scott, of South Carolina, who chairs the National Republican Senatorial Committee, has made his case for Cornyn to White House officials. Scott also told Rep. Wesley Hunt, R-Texas, who has also been weighing a Senate run, that the NRSC is behind Cornyn, according to a source familiar with the discussions.   “John Cornyn is a leader who delivers on President Trump’s agenda and for the people of Texas in the U.S. Senate,” Scott said in a statement to NBC News. “He’s a proven fighter, man of faith and essential part of the Republican Senate Majority.”   Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., has also been publicly backing Cornyn and recently told CNN he was hopeful Trump would back Cornyn in the race.   Asked Wednesday if he has personally asked Trump to endorse Cornyn, Thune told reporters at the Capitol: “Well, we’re having conversations about all of the races on the map. When we have anything to report, we’ll let you know.”  Senate Leadership Fund, the main GOP super PAC involved in Senate races, which is aligned with Republican leadership, indicated it is also in Cornyn's corner. ""Leader John Thune, NRSC Chairman Tim Scott, and many of their colleagues have expressed great admiration and support for Senator John Cornyn and his years of service to the people of Texas,"" SLF Chairman Cory Gardner, a former senator from Colorado, said in a statement to NBC News. ""The Senate Leadership Fund fully intends on seeing him reelected next November."" Mackowiak, a longtime Texas political consultant, told NBC News that he sees Paxton’s early announcement as an indication of two things: The attorney general sees an opening, but he knows he needs time to raise the money required to combat Cornyn and the power of incumbency.   “Paxton’s never run a race this complicated, this expensive against someone as accomplished and serious as John Cornyn,"" he said. ""John Cornyn has never been challenged by someone that has the statewide profile and grassroots enthusiasm Paxton has.""  But Mackowiak argued that while Paxton has sought to go on offense early, that dynamic may not stick, and that the events that led to Paxton’s impeachment trial (which divided Republicans in the state) will likely be relitigated.   “He is going to be playing a lot more defense than he even understands. I think because he got through impeachment, these issues are behind him. They’re not,” he said.   One potential wrinkle, particularly if Hunt or another Republican decides to jump in, is Texas’ runoff rules. If no candidate wins the majority of the vote in the primary, the top two move on to a one-on-one runoff election.   Cornyn has never lost an election in Texas, and he’s never been forced to a runoff by any of his opponents (who have largely challenged him from the right). But the prospect of a split field leading to a runoff is another complicating factor, with both Mackowiak and Steinhauser noting that runoff electorates typically favor the candidate with more grassroots conservative support.  The Texas race could have broader implications for the fight for the Senate next year as Republicans look to defend their slim majority.    Democrats need to net three seats to take control of the Senate, but they face an uphill battle with a short list of targets. Just one Republican — Maine’s Susan Collins — is running in a state that former Vice President Kamala Harris carried in November. Republicans, meanwhile, are looking to grow their majority by targeting Democratic-held seats in battleground states.  But Cornyn said a competitive election in Texas could put a strain on Republicans nationally by diverting money away from other key battlegrounds.   “We’re going to end up spending hundreds of millions of dollars, potentially, on this race in Texas, because we can’t lose the seat in Texas,” said Cornyn, a former NRSC chairman. “And that is money that can’t be used in places like Michigan, New Hampshire and Georgia in the midterm elections.”  Democrats have long coveted the idea of flipping Texas, with former Rep. Beto O’Rourke coming close to defeating Cruz in the blue wave year of 2018. But Trump expanded his margin last year in Texas compared to 2020, carrying Texas by 14 percentage points as Cruz defeated former Democratic Rep. Colin Allred by 9 points.  Allred told The Dallas Morning News last month that he is “seriously considering” another run for Senate against Cornyn. Cruz, meanwhile, told reporters Wednesday that he is staying neutral in this year’s Senate primary, saying both Paxton and Cornyn are friends.   “I have worked closely with both of them. I respect them both,” Cruz said. “And I trust the voters of Texas to make that decision.”  A divisive GOP primary could play into Democrats’ hands — especially if Paxton is the nominee. In the meantime, Democrats are watching the GOP primary process play out in Texas and other states. Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee spokesperson Maeve Coyle noted that former New Hampshire GOP Gov. Chris Sununu announced Tuesday that he would not be running for that state’s open Senate seat.   “As Republicans face a nasty primary in Texas and an embarrassing recruitment failure in New Hampshire — coupled with a building midterm backlash across the map driven by their threats to Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and their push to spike costs for families — Democrats will look for every opportunity to put them on defense,” Coyle said.

305,"Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News  news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time In the wake of President Donald Trump’s announcement Wednesday afternoon that he was pausing country-by-country tariffs by 90 days, some experts — as well as critics of Trump and social media users — are raising questions about a statement he posted earlier in the day that may have indicated the massive sell-off in stocks in recent days was coming to an end.   Not long after trading opened at 9:30 a.m. Wednesday, Trump took to his Truth Social platform and wrote: “BE COOL! Everything is going to work out well. The USA will be bigger and better than ever before!” Four minutes later, he wrote: “THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!! DJT” Just before 1:30 p.m., Trump announced the pause, sending stocks soaring. The tech-heavy Nasdaq index had its biggest one-day gain since 2008, rising nearly 12%, while the S&P 500 climbed 9.5% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 8%, or about 2,800 points.  Trump could have been generally urging people to buy into the market while prices were relatively low. That was the response Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick gave when he was asked about the posts Wednesday evening on CNBC. “Donald Trump understands that … America is the greatest country, all right? We are the greatest country, and we have the capacity for incredible greatness. But someone needs to take the shackles off.” But on social media, some users raised the prospect — without evidence — of market manipulation, while others began referring to the market’s sharp turn upward as the “Trump Pump.”    There is no evidence to suggest that Trump was seeking to manipulate markets or that he or any of his advisers acted on inside information For Richard Painter, chief ethics lawyer for former President George W. Bush, who now teaches government ethics and security regulation at the University of Minnesota’s law school, the morning posts, at a minimum, leave Trump open to questions about his intentions.   “This is a scenario that could expose the president to accusations that he engaged in market manipulation,” Painter said.  Even before he’d been sworn in for his second term, Trump faced insider-trading criticisms amid the launch of his $TRUMP meme coin. In that incident, the Trump Organization was explicit that a group of investors who were helping launch the coin stood to benefit from its release assuming its price went up. Still, reports showed other investors reaping outsized profits from the launch, including one crypto-wallet owner or owners who earned $109 million, according to a New York Times analysis. Some Democrats were quick to blast Trump’s actions on Wednesday. ""An insider trading scandal is brewing,"" Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., posted on X. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., told NBC News that the Trump administration is “replete with grifters” and that “corruption is its middle name.”  “Insider trading is a real threat, and I hope there will be a surge of penetrating investigations into the potential for manipulation and insider trading of securities,” Blumenthal said, “since the knowledge of what Trump’s plans have been and may be is widely spread.” Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif. — a frequent object of Trump’s scorn — also suggested an inquiry was warranted. “Trump is creating giant market fluctuations with his on-again, off-again tariffs,” Schiff wrote on social media. “These constant gyrations in policy provide dangerous opportunities for insider trading. Who in the administration knew about Trump’s latest tariff flip flop ahead of time? Did anyone buy or sell  stocks, and profit at the public’s expense? I’m writing to the White House — the public has a right to know.” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., pointed to the upcoming May 15 deadline for members of Congress to submit their financial disclosure reports, writing on X, ""Any member of Congress who purchased stocks in the last 48 hours should probably disclose that now. I’ve been hearing some interesting chatter on the floor."" A White House spokesman rejected the Democrats’ assertions. “It is the responsibility of the President of the United States to reassure the markets and Americans about their economic security in the face of nonstop media fearmongering,” White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement. “Instead of grasping at straws to try landing a punch on President Trump, Democrats should focus on working with the administration to restore American Greatness.” A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment. The Securities and Exchange Commission did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Painter said the incident could result in investigations “into who knew what and when before [Trump] announced he was going to postpone the tariffs on all the countries except for China.” “This was a terrible idea to make those posts,” Painter said of Trump’s suggestion that it was “a great time to buy.”  Painter further admonished Trump, saying, “I would hope that he would focus on doing his job — and try to calm the markets and have a predictable trade policy and let the markets do their thing without the White House giving what appears to be investment advice.” Rob Wile is a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist covering breaking business stories for NBCNews.com. © 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

364,"Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News  news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time As President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariff plans sent stocks tumbling and economists warning of a broader economic slowdown, many of Trump’s supporters say they support the move as part of a broader vision for the U.S. economy, even if prices rise. But a slice of 2024 Trump voters are deeply concerned, illustrating the real potential political peril for the president and his party. In interviews, 20 swing-state Trump voters who participated in last month’s national NBC News poll spoke about Trump and his tariffs after the president's policy announcement last week. Most are either fully on board with Trump’s vision — with many explicitly saying they are willing to live through short-term economic pain if it means achieving his vision of reordering the global economy to America’s benefit — or are cautiously optimistic that the tariffs will be effective negotiating tools. Veronica Rogers, a retiree in Georgia, was among those who said that Trump’s long-term goals of bringing back jobs to the United States outweigh her concerns about temporary higher prices. “Whether that’d be short term, or that’d be long term, I don’t know. I’m not an economist. But I do know that there’s billions and trillions of dollars that can be spent here to build industry to keep from paying tariffs. So, that sounds good to me,” she said. She was stunned that some people were taken aback by the scale of Trump’s tariffs, noting how frequently he talked about tariffs while campaigning. “Nothing they’re doing is news to people that voted for him,” Rogers, 63, said. Still, a handful of voters, including those who backed Trump in 2020 and 2024, warned that his tariff rollout threatens to squander one of his major campaign promises: to lower prices for Americans in the long term. The NBC News poll conducted in March, before Trump fully unveiled his tariff plans, found that a majority of Americans (55%) disapproved of his handling of inflation and the cost of living, while 54% disapproved of his handling of the economy overall. Members of the GOP were far more likely to give Trump passing marks on the economy than were independents and Democrats, but about 1 in 10 Republicans expressed displeasure with his handling of the key issues. “The track he’s on right now is just to piss the Democrats off, and I think it’s kind of working, but no, I’m not really too happy with the way things are going right now. He’s really gone off the wall,” said Cathy Phillips, a 64-year-old Pennsylvanian who voted for Trump in 2020 and 2024. “We’re scraping pennies together, I know how hard it is for us,” she continued. “I can’t imagine how hard it is for seniors who are even older than us. Something’s gotta give somewhere.” Yet, for many of these voters, Trump’s decision to put heavy tariffs on some of America’s biggest trading partners, such as the European Union, China and Vietnam, as well as most other countries, is exactly what they signed up for. “I feel like everything that I voted for has come to fruition already and more,” said Melanie Renaud, a 52-year-old dental hygienist from North Carolina. Some point to local factories that shuttered and moved jobs overseas, leaving behind crumbling communities, to argue for drastic steps to bring jobs back to the U.S. Others believe some of the sky-high tariff rates are a hard-edged negotiating tactic aimed at compelling countries to make immediate concessions that will help the American economy in the long term. Others said it’s a needed response to an economy they believe wasn’t working for them. “This trade war has to happen in order for fair trade to happen. And once fair trade is accomplished, I think prices will even back out,” said Reece Westfall, a 30-year-old Pennsylvania Republican.  “There’s a lot more to this than the price of everything,” Westfall continued, echoing recent arguments from Trump administration officials, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on NBC News’ “Meet the Press.” Donna J., 55, who declined to give her last name, said that while her part of North Carolina had a long history of textile mills like the one in which her grandfather worked, the town “basically folded in upon itself” once that factory closed. “What you get used to, sometimes, is the very thing that will kill you,” she said of how the globalized economy has hurt communities like hers. She said Americans need to “learn some patience and understand this is for the betterment of everyone,” calling the tariffs an example of Trump’s “promises made, promises kept.” But other voters who backed Trump were critical of the president’s approach. David, a Wisconsin man who voted for Trump in 2020 and 2024, said the administration is “throwing spaghetti at the wall to see what sticks.” (Like some others who were critical of Trump, he declined to share his last name because of concerns about retribution or harassment.) “I cannot see a reasonable businessperson in the near term looking at this and saying, ‘I feel confident that I can invest millions of dollars into a new production facility and create new jobs in the U.S.,” he said, later adding, “I was expecting a more reasoned and logical rollout.” David said he voted for Trump because of the economy, believing a continuation of Biden administration policies if Kamala Harris had won the election would not have been good for the country. But despite his hesitance about Trump’s economic policies, David said he would still vote for him if given a chance for a do-over, even if it was less than a full-throated support. “I would like to think that there would be a better option in the future,” he added. Another Trump voter, who declined to give his first or last name because of concerns about harassment or retaliation, said he now sees his vote for Trump as a “big mistake.” The 64-year-old Arizona man said his retirement savings have fallen 35% in recent weeks, and he may now have to delay his retirement. “It’s happened without any reasonable explanation,” he said “I don’t understand. I don’t understand how to declare a trade war on the world, how to betray the allies, I can’t understand it.” Many of the Trump voters who spoke to NBC News said they didn’t believe the high tariffs would last, instead predicting that they would compel other countries to the negotiating table. “I wouldn’t be surprised if, in the next month or two, we see a lot of these countries do bilateral negotiations,” said John, a 30-year-old from Arizona who voted for Trump in 2016 and 2024 but supported Joe Biden in 2020. “Part of these extremely high tariffs are designed, in a sense, in my belief, as a way to get more from these countries,” he continued. Ultimately, some of Trump’s most ardent supporters said they would be personally willing to take their lumps now, both in terms of potential rising prices and an unstable stock market, if it meant that the president's plans to reorient the global economy succeed, because they believe it will leave a better future for their children. “I’m willing to not look at my [401k] numbers on a daily basis. I’m willing to trust President Trump that it will turn around,” said Jodi L., a 62-year-old from Michigan. “I have to do my part. I can call up and complain all I want, but I believe it’s on the right path to turning this country around. I believe in him and what he’s said he would do because he’s proven himself in less than 100 days.” “I’m willing to take the knock if that’s what it takes for the long term.” Sherry Behr, a 67-year-old Republican from Pennsylvania, said, “I trust President Trump, that in six months, a year, we’ll start seeing a difference.”  Most Trump voters said they could not envision a scenario that would cause them to pull their support for him. But a few noted there might be a financial breaking point depending on how high prices go, and for how long. “If it goes like $100 for a pair of shoes, for stupid shoes, then we’re gonna have issues then,” said Nyssa, a 33-year-old stay-at-home mom in Pennsylvania, who said she backed Trump in hopes he would bring down grocery prices. “But a couple bucks here and there is not gonna really hurt anything.” And for a smaller few, the tariff debate has demonstrated that Trump isn’t following through on a key promise, either because of a perceived lack of attention or push to prioritize vengeance over solutions. David, the Wisconsin man, noted that Trump specifically criticized the Biden administration on high prices during the 2024 campaign. “And then shortly after coming into office, all sudden the tune changes, and it’s like, ‘Well, we’re going to see some prices go up,’” he said. Chelsea Linares, a 33-year-old insurance account manager in Georgia, told NBC News that Trump’s work on the economy has been a “slower start that I would say myself, and others, have anticipated,” noting prices are still high. While she’s still “optimistic,” she thinks “it’s going to get worse before it gets better.” “Even people that support Trump are probably going to be more pissed than they thought,” she said, adding that she still supported him. Blake, a three-time Trump voter from Arizona who is in his 30s, described himself as someone in “full ideological agreement” with the president on many issues. He said he would have scored Trump a 10/10 for his administration’s efforts in its first few days on issues including immigration and ending diversity, equity and inclusion programs. But he panned the tariff rollout as “lazy,” adding that the push could squander the full control of Washington that voters gave Republicans after the 2024 election. “I could be wrong, but I feel the cannonball way they came out with this is maximizing the pain without necessarily optimizing the speed we recover from it,” he said.

In today’s edition, we dive into President Donald Trump’s sudden decision to pause many of his new tariffs. Plus, we explain why Texas is set to host one of the most intense contests of the 2026 midterms. And Andrea Mitchell previews the upcoming nuclear talks between the United States and Iran.  Sign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here. — Adam Wollner One week after his “Liberation Day,” President Donald Trump said he was pausing higher targeted tariffs for most countries for 90 days, a stunning reversal in his trade war that sent markets reeling.  In a social media post just before 1:30 p.m., Trump wrote that he came to the decision because more than 75 trading partners did not retaliate and have reached out to the United States to “discuss” some of the issues he had raised.   But the pause didn’t apply to China, which has retaliated with 84% hikes. Trump instead raised duties for it to 125%, effective immediately.    Zooming out: The trade war isn’t exactly over, and the pause didn’t return the world to the time before Trump touched off the global instability. A 10% across-the-board duty will remain — including for some products from Canada and Mexico.  The White House wouldn’t say which countries would be covered by the pause. Earlier Wednesday the European Union voted to impose fresh retaliatory duties, but they aren’t set to take effect until next week.  And separate tariffs on imported autos, steel and aluminum will remain, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said later — while planned tariffs on items like lumber and pharmaceuticals are still on.  How Wall Street responded: Markets soared on the surprising news Wednesday, with the S&P 500 climbing more than 9%, the tech-heavy Nasdaq closing up more than 12% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average ending nearly 3,000 points higher.   Goldman Sachs lowered its odds of a recession but said it is still forecasting minimal economic growth and a 45% probability of a recession given the remaining tariffs in place. What Trump said: Trump appeared to dig in on his tariff plan just hours earlier, telling Americans “BE COOL” on Truth Social. And he suggested not that long ago that the tariffs could be permanent.   “I thought that people were jumping a little bit out of line. They were getting yippie, you know, they were getting a little bit yippie, a little bit afraid,” he told reporters at the White House. “So we’ll see how it all works out. I think it’s going to work out amazing,” he added. Read more →  Related reads: Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton’s attempt to topple Republican Sen.

Cornyn is a fixture of the Republican Party in Texas, serving in its highest offices for more than 30 years and becoming a key voice on Capitol Hill. Paxton, the third-term attorney general who survived a bipartisan impeachment last year in part thanks to support from Trump and conservative activist allies, believes there’s an opening to cut him down from the right.   Now, both sides are aligning themselves with Trump amid the possibility of an endorsement that could tip the primary.

Leading the talks for Iran: Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, a veteran of nuclear negotiations. But so far, the two sides can’t even agree on the nature of the talks.  President Donald Trump told reporters they would be holding direct talks, which Iran has rejected since Trump withdrew in 2018 from the multinational Iran nuclear deal President Barack Obama’s secretary of state, John Kerry, negotiated three years earlier. Araghchi says they’ve agreed only to hold indirect talks, exchanging proposals through diplomatic go-betweens as they’d done with the Biden administration for two years, which went nowhere.  The stakes are serious: Iran has been processing nuclear fuel so rapidly it now has the ability to create one bomb within a week or two, according to the United Nations, former Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Trump administration warnings — though it would still take an estimated year or longer for Tehran to be able to create a warhead small enough for one of its ballistic missiles to carry.  Why are the talks so critical? Trump warned Monday that “it’s getting to be very dangerous territory, and hopefully those talks will be successful. And I think it would be in Iran’s best interests if they are successful.” Last month, he was more explicit, telling “Meet the Press” moderator Kristen Welker, “If they don’t make a deal, there will be bombing, and it will be bombing the likes of which they have never seen before.”  Multiple U.S. officials told NBC News that Iran is vulnerable to an attack: Israel’s retaliatory strike against Iran last fall eliminated many of Tehran’s air defenses. Israel has also killed the leader of Hezbollah, Iran’s proxy and front line of defense in neighboring Lebanon. Hamas’ leaders in Gaza, also Iran’s proxies, are gone. So is Tehran’s powerful ally in Syria, Bashar al-Assad. Trump has repeatedly signaled that he doesn’t want a war with Iran. To avoid one, the two sides have to at least agree, finally, to come face to face. That’s all From the Politics Desk for now. Today’s newsletter was compiled by Adam Wollner.

365,"Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News  news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time A federal judge in Texas issued an order Wednesday temporarily blocking the Trump administration’s use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport people held in a south Texas immigration detention center without due process. A second federal judge in New York said in a hearing that he planned a similar order applying to migrants held in the Southern District of New York.   In Texas, U.S. District Judge Fernando Rodriguez Jr., in Brownsville, blocked the removal of any person held in El Valle Detention Center in Raymondville, who could be subject to President Donald Trump’s proclamation invoking the Alien Enemies Act, a wartime  deportation law.   District Judge Alvin Hellerstein in the Southern District of New York said he would issue a temporary restraining order Wednesday blocking the Trump administration from deporting without a proper notice and hearing any Venezuelan migrants the administration has said are removable under the act. NBC News has reached out to the Justice Department for comment on both cases. Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act last month after declaring the Venezuela gang Tren de Aragua an invading force. Immigration officials have since used that act to deport hundreds of people, without immigration hearings, alleging that they are members of the gang. Many have ended up in a mega-prison in El Salvador known for its harsh conditions and reported abuse.  The judges made their decisions in separate habeas petitions filed, in Texas, by the American Civil Liberties Union and the ACLU of Texas, and in New York by the ACLU Foundation. They follow the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision Monday, allowing the Trump administration to deport men it alleges are members of the Tren de Aragua gang under the Alien Enemies Act.  The nation’s highest court ruled that the original lawsuit, filed in Washington, should have been filed in the state where the plaintiffs were detained. It also ruled that the plaintiffs should be allowed to challenge their detentions and whether the Alien Enemies Act is being lawfully applied to them.  The ACLU's lawsuit in Texas was filed on behalf of three Venezuelans who are being held at the El Valle Detention Center. Rodriguez specifically blocked the removals of those plaintiffs, identified in the lawsuit as W.G.H, J.G.G. and J.A.V.  But he also blocked the Trump administration from removing anyone currently housed at El Valle Detention Center identified by the government as subject to removal under the president's March 15 proclamation targeting members of Tren de Aragua. The judge also blocked any transportation or relocation of ""such persons"" outside of Willacy and Cameron counties in Texas without a court order. The order is in effect until 5 p.m., April 23.  Rodriguez scheduled a hearing at 1:30 p.m. Friday to consider whether to extend the temporary restraining order or issue other forms of emergency relief.  He said he issued the order preventing their removal so that the plaintiffs could develop ""a fuller record"" for the court as it considers their request for a preliminary injunction and other relief. He also said he issued the order ""to prevent the immediate and irreparable injury that may occur with the immediate removal of any Venezuelan"" immigrant who may be subject to the president's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act.  In the New York case brought by two Venezuelans, Hellerstein said Wednesday that he would issue an order temporarily blocking the deportations of individuals in the jurisdiction of the Southern District under the Alien Enemies Act.  He said those detained within the Southern District of New York must be given “appropriate” or “proper” notice and a chance to challenge the government’s allegations in court.  “Given the history, it seems they need to be protected and given the opportunity before they are deported,” Hellerstein said The government said Hellerstein’s order would apply to less than 10 people in the district.  The Alien Enemies Act of 1798, not used since World War II, allows the president to detain noncitizens in wartime and remove them when the country is under invasion or experiencing ""predatory incursion."" The law was most notably when people of Japanese descent in the U.S. were rounded up and held in internment camps; the government also held people of German and Italian descent.   The Supreme Court decision left various legal questions about the use of the Alien Enemies Act undecided, including whether the Trump administration can invoke it against gang members. In its filing in Texas, the ACLU said the administration has yet to explain what notice it intends to provide.  ""That the government has yet to do so is especially problematic given the position it took"" before the Supreme Court's ruling that were the injunction blocking deportation of the detainees lifted, it would in no uncertain terms immediately begin deporting plaintiffs without notice, the group said in its complaint.   In the original lawsuit filed by the ACLU, Washington-based U.S. District Judge James Boasberg blocked Trump's deportations of the plaintiffs and had provisionally certified the lawsuit as a class-action suit applying to all Venezuelans in U.S. custody who were not U.S. citizens. The Supreme Court's decision lifted that order.  The original case led to sparring between the administration and Boasberg, who has questioned whether Trump administration lawyers ignored his verbal order to turn around or return planes carrying the deportees back to the U.S.   In a separate case, a federal judge in Maryland has ordered the government to return Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a U.S. resident with protected legal status, who has a 5-year-old son who is autistic and intellectually disabled, to the country after the government acknowledged it erroneously sent him to the El Salvador prison.

367,"Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News  news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time WASHINGTON — As President Donald Trump ramps up attacks on the judiciary, the Republican-led House voted Wednesday to limit district court judges’ ability to issue the nationwide injunctions that have hampered some of his executive actions.  The vote was 219-213, with just one Republican, Mike Turner of Ohio, joining all Democrats in opposing it. The bill now heads to the Senate, where it would almost certainly be blocked by a Democratic filibuster if it were brought to the floor. Trump and many of his allies on the far right had been pushing House Republicans to take a more extreme step and attempt to impeach judges that stood in his way. The ""No Rogue Rulings Act,"" authored by Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., doesn’t go that far, but it allows House Republicans to voice their support for Trump on the issue while avoiding politically perilous impeachment votes that would be all but doomed to fail. Follow live politics coverage here In a brief interview, Issa argued that both parties would benefit from the legislation. He said that during President Joe Biden's administration, Democrats howled when conservative judges issued nationwide injunctions against his executive actions.  ""This is a growing problem that has vexed both Republican and Democrat presidents,"" Issa, a senior member of the Judiciary Committee and the former chairman of the Oversight Committee, said before the vote. Biden, ""to the very end, was trying to get this process of activist judges exceeding their jurisdiction rolled back."" This bill, Issa said, ""limits judges to the original intent, which will allow them to make decisions but only as to the plaintiffs."" Trump and his allies have grown frustrated with lower-court judges’ issuing injunctions blocking Trump’s actions on deportations of undocumented immigrants, sweeping cuts and mass firings at federal agencies, ending birthright citizenship and other matters. Much of Republicans' criticism has centered on U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, who halted Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants alleged to be Tren de Aragua gang members.  After that decision, Rep. Brandon Gill, R-Texas, a Trump ally, introduced a resolution to impeach Boasberg, who is based in Washington, D.C. Other judges who have ruled against Trump also have faced impeachment threats, including U.S. District Judges Paul A. Engelmayer and John Bates. But GOP leaders have acknowledged such impeachment resolutions wouldn't have enough support to pass out of the House, where Republicans hold a narrow 220-213 majority.  On top of that, 67 votes would be needed for convictions in the Senate, where Republicans have a 53-47 majority. In some high-profile cases, the conservative-leaning Supreme Court has been ruling in Trump’s favor. On Monday, it tossed out Boasberg’s decision blocking the removal of the alleged gang members to El Salvador. A day later, the Supreme Court halted a ruling by U.S. District Judge William Alsup of California requiring some federal agencies to reinstate roughly 16,000 workers the Trump administration had tried to fire. Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, said his party in the past has tried to block ""judicial forum shopping,"" in which plaintiffs try to pick courts where they have higher chances of winning. ""But a nationwide injunction is a necessary part of the judicial tool kit,"" said Raskin, a former constitutional law professor. ""Why should every person affected [by an issue] have to go to court? Why should millions of people have to create their own case?""  ""Why should Brown vs. Board of Education have applied to just Linda Brown as opposed to everybody affected?"" he added.

368,"Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News  news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Gretchen Whitmer became governor after promising to “fix the damn roads” in Michigan.  Whether she goes any further depends on how well she can navigate some of the early bumps surfacing as she positions herself for a possible White House bid. On Wednesday, during a trip to Washington, D.C., that put a spotlight on her prospects in 2028, Whitmer hit what many of her fellow Democrats saw as two sizable potholes. First, in a policy speech outlining a “consistent national strategy,” Whitmer staked out common ground with President Donald Trump. And though Whitmer criticized Trump’s sweeping, roller-coaster rollout of — and subsequent retreat from — tariffs, she said she was not against tariffs “outright” and expressed understanding of Trump’s “motivation” behind deploying them. That drew a social media rebuke from Colorado’s Democratic governor, Jared Polis. “Tariffs are bad outright because they lead to higher prices and destroy American manufacturing,” Polis, another potential 2028 contender who has also sought ways to find common cause with Trump, wrote on X. “Trade is inherently good because both parties emerge better off from a consensual transaction.” Then, later Wednesday, Whitmer joined Trump in the Oval Office. She was scheduled to meet privately with him and discuss Michigan issues. That wasn’t how it ultimately played out.  Instead, she stood by as he signed several executive orders, including two calling for Justice Department probes of officials who served in his first administration and called him out for falsely claiming the 2020 election was stolen. He made the false claims about the election’s being “rigged” again Wednesday. Whitmer was invited into the Oval Office alongside Michigan state House Speaker Matt Hall, a Republican, as Trump held court with reporters and signed the executive orders. Photos showed Whitmer standing uncomfortably against a door as the cameras rolled. “She’s really done an excellent job,” Trump said of Whitmer during the impromptu media availability. “Very good person.” Though Trump did engage with her on issues she came to discuss, the fact that she was present at what amounted to a bipartisan photo opportunity as he took actions targeting political critics angered and confused allies. “Just a f---ing disaster,” said a Democratic operative who admires Whitmer and, like others interviewed for this article, was granted anonymity to share candid thoughts about her day. “It feels like it removes some of the momentum she had as a politically savvy swing-state Dem.” Whitmer’s team moved quickly to contain the fallout and counter mounting criticism from within her party. “The governor was surprised that she was brought into the Oval Office during President Trump’s press conference without any notice of the subject matter,” a Whitmer spokesperson said in a statement. “Her presence is not an endorsement of the actions taken or statements made at that event.” Democrats have long seen Whitmer as one of the party’s more formidable figures — a two-term governor of a battleground state who won re-election in a landslide and was nearly tapped to be Joe Biden’s running mate in 2020 after having considerably raised her public profile during the Covid pandemic. Whitmer is among a handful of prominent Democratic governors viewed as potential presidential contenders in 2028. But unlike some of her contemporaries, Whitmer has chosen to seek out a stronger working relationship with Trump in his second term. Trump won her state last fall, and Whitmer views herself as more of a center-left moderate with a middle-of-the-road, Midwestern constituency — one that is receptive to Trump’s message, including and especially on manufacturing and tariff policy.  In her Washington speech Wednesday, Whitmer called for cutting red tape and building more in the United States. She also railed against “partisanship,” saying it has seemingly “infected every aspect of our lives, and it’s exhausting.” “Let’s give more hard-working people a fair shot at a decent life,” she said. “And let’s usher in, as President Trump says, a ‘Golden Age’ of American manufacturing.” She did break with Trump on the more substantial tariffs he announced last week and partially paused later Wednesday afternoon, describing them as a “triple whammy: higher costs, fewer jobs and more uncertainty.” “I understand the motivation behind the tariffs, and I can tell you here’s where President Trump and I do agree,” she said. “We do need to make more stuff in America — more cars and chips, more steel and ships. We do need fair trade.” Her stance on tariffs puts her at odds with other potential Democratic presidential hopefuls, like Polis and Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, who offered sharp criticism of Trump’s “wrongheaded” measures in a speech in his state Wednesday. During a question-and-answer session with journalist Gretchen Carlson after her speech, Whitmer empathized with the many Democrats who don’t want Democratic officials to work with Trump. But she said she needs to be collaborative because “I took an oath to the people of Michigan to try to get as much done for the state.” Whitmer also said she hadn’t “thought through” how she’d handle tariffs differently from Trump, only that they should be used as a “scalpel.” A national Democratic strategist said, “It is a massive indictment on Whitmer and her team’s judgment to, first, not have an answer on the tariff question and then go the White House and get absolutely played by Donald Trump to the point she is caught in the Oval Office as he signs one of his revenge and retribution executive orders and says 2020 was rigged.”  About tariffs, her spokesperson emphasized areas of disagreement with Trump rather than ways the two overlap on the policy.  “This morning, the governor delivered a speech in Washington, D.C., about the devastating effects tariffs were having on Michiganders — from companies increasing prices and laying off workers to retirement accounts being wiped out,” Whitmer’s spokesperson said. “This afternoon, the 90-day pause was announced, and that is a step in the right direction and will provide relief to so many businesses across the state, but we remain concerned about tariffs that will hurt American auto companies.” Whitmer and Hall were supposed to discuss with Trump federal investment at Michigan’s Selfridge Air National Guard Base, a recent devastating ice storm in the state and a plan to deal with invasive Asian carp in Lake Michigan. Whitmer’s team and her allies described the meeting as a success on those matters. “Governor Whitmer thanks President Trump for his acknowledgements on protecting the Great Lakes from invasive carp, his work on Selfridge, and his openness to our request for help in northern Michigan,” her spokesperson said. A Democratic official who used to work with Whitmer said her dealings with Trump show she “is very good at advocating for her state.” “And President Trump clearly listens to what she says and what she does,” this person said. “You saw that today on tariffs, on the progress they made on Selfridge and on the other issues she brought to discuss.” Whitmer’s day also offered some political nuance. Her visit to the Oval Office didn’t annoy just Democrats. Republicans complained that it was an unnecessary boost to a leader they have long tried to demonize in a crucial electoral battleground. “Trump literally just f---ed Republicans in Michigan by saying Whitmer is doing an excellent job,” a Republican strategist from Michigan wrote in a text message. “I mean, WTF, she is running to replace him in 2028.” The budding Trump-Whitmer relationship — Wednesday’s meeting was their second in less than two months — would have been unthinkable not so long ago. Trump figured prominently in the political memoir Whitmer published last year, with a long-standing feud between them accounting for a large share of the first chapter: “Don’t Let the Bullies Get You Down.”  Whitmer wrote about how Trump responded to her criticism of his leadership during the early days of the pandemic by branding her dismissively and derisively as “that woman from Michigan.” Whitmer and her team embraced the insulting sobriquet, which became a staple in progressive merchandising. “That’s the secret to dealing with bullies: You take their weapon and make it your shield,” Whitmer wrote. “Every time Trump gave me a nickname, I made it my own.” That history had some observers struggling with cognitive dissonance Wednesday. “Whitmer hurt her candidacy today,” a Democratic strategist said. “She looked and sounded nervous in the Oval Office. That visual will stick. So will the image of Trump praising her as he signed executive orders targeting his critics.”  A second Democratic operative who has worked with Whitmer previously said her speech today felt like an “opening salvo” for a presidential bid. “There’s sort of this absolutism among Democrats where you’re either all against him or you’re not against him enough, right?” this person said. “And I think if you are a Midwestern governor, there are certainly appropriate times to be for tariffs.”  This person was surprised at the pushback she got from Polis after her address, adding that criticism showed “2028 is on.” But the person was also perplexed by Whitmer’s Oval Office appearance. “It overall seemed not great,” this person said. “The photo of her standing there in the corner looking uncomfortable. The odd banter. The whole thing didn’t make a lot of sense. Why did it happen? Whose idea was that?” Still, this person said Whitmer, who has pledged to work across the aisle, including with Trump, to deliver results for her state, can point to tangible results from her trip to Michiganders.  But nationally, the conversation around her visit will be very different. “Overall, hey, great visit, right?” this person continued, rattling off the local issues Whitmer went to discuss — before pivoting to the executive order spectacle. “It felt like, holy s---, what just happened?” Allan Smith is a political reporter for NBC News.

369,"Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News  news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time WASHINGTON — “Liberation Day” just gave way to Capitulation Day. President Donald Trump pulled back Wednesday on a series of harsh tariffs targeting friends and foes alike in an audacious bid to remake the global economic order.  Trump's early afternoon announcement followed a harrowing week in which Republican lawmakers and confidants privately warned him that the tariffs could wreck the economy. His own aides had quietly raised alarms about the financial markets before he suspended a tariff regime that he had unveiled with a flourish just one week earlier in a Rose Garden ceremony. Follow live politics coverage here The stock market rose immediately after the about-face, ending days of losses that have forced older Americans who've been sinking their savings into 401(k)s to rethink their retirement plans. Ahead of Trump's announcement, some of his advisers had been in a near panic about the bond markets, according to a senior administration official. Interest rates on 10-year Treasury bonds had been rising, contrary to what normally happens when stock prices fall and investors seek safety in treasuries. The unusual dynamic meant that at the same time the tariffs could push up prices, people would be paying more to buy homes or pay off credit card debt because of higher interest rates. Businesses looking to expand would pay more for new loans. Two of Trump's most senior advisers, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, presented a united front Wednesday, urging him to suspend the tariffs in light of the bond market, the administration official said. In a social media post, Trump announced a 90-day pause that he said he’ll use to negotiate deals with dozens of countries that have expressed openness to revising trade terms that he contends exploit American businesses and workers. One exception is China. Trump upped the tariff on the country’s biggest geopolitical rival to 125%, part of a tit-for-tat escalation in an evolving trade war. Trump reversed course one week after he appeared in the Rose Garden and unveiled his plan to bring jobs back to the United States. Displaying a chart showing the new, elevated tariffs that countries would face, Trump proclaimed, “My fellow Americans, this is Liberation Day.” It proved short-lived. Markets plunged in anticipation of heightened trade wars, wiping out trillions of dollars in wealth. Democrats seized on the issue, looking to undercut a source of Trump’s popular appeal: the view that he can be trusted to steer the nation’s economy.  “Donald Trump’s market crash has vaporized a whopping $104,000 from the average retirement account,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Wednesday on the Senate floor, hours before Trump’s reversal. The episode laid bare the rifts within Trump’s team of senior advisers as the White House struggled to offer a clear, consistent argument about the duration of the tariffs. While Bessent seemed open to negotiations, Peter Navarro, a senior trade adviser, appeared to take a more hard-line posture.  Elon Musk, the billionaire Tesla CEO who has been advising Trump on the government workforce, called Navarro “dumber than a sack of bricks,” while Navarro described Musk as someone who is merely “a car assembler, in many cases.” But the weeklong drama also underscored the peril of a policymaking process that is often tied to the wishes and vagaries of one man: Trump. Asked about the dust-up between Musk and Navarro, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a golf partner of Trump’s, said: “I don’t think it matters. The only one who matters is Trump.” Markets tend to favor predictability, as do business leaders deciding where to build new plants. When Trump sets a course, however, there are bound to be detours. A friend of his who spoke to him in recent days said Trump gave no sign he was about to “back down quickly on this stuff.” Trump believes other countries trade unfairly and sees tariffs as a tool to make the United States more competitive, the person said. “He’s very confident it’s going to work for him,” the person added, speaking on condition of anonymity. And yet in the run-up to Wednesday’s announcement, Trump and his aides were also hearing from GOP lawmakers and outside allies urging an alternative path. One was Larry Kudlow, who hosts a show on Fox Business Network and was a senior economic adviser in Trump’s first term. Kudlow told NBC News that he has had “ongoing” talks with friends in the West Wing about the need to negotiate with other countries before the United States slaps them with tariffs that stand in perpetuity. Describing Trump’s move Wednesday as “fabulous,” Kudlow added: “Dealmaking is the best thing to do. In the last 48 hours, Trump has gone from non-negotiating to negotiating. It’s very clear that Bessent is now the point man on trade. Very clear.” Anxious GOP lawmakers also weighed in. Graham said he spoke to Trump at length Tuesday night and told him he has been hearing from car manufacturers who are worried about how the tariffs would affect their business. BMW operates a plant in Graham’s home state and is one of the companies he said he has spoken to. Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., a lawmaker who was also in touch with the administration, said Tuesday that he planned to have lunch with Bessent. On Wednesday, he told NBC News he was also talking to the White House. Kennedy likened Trump to the “pit bull who caught the car.” Now, he said, the question becomes: “What are you going to do with the car?” After more market losses this week, and with pressure mounting from Republicans on Capitol Hill, Trump began having second thoughts. In his first term, he often viewed the ups and downs of the stock market as a kind of report card on his presidency, celebrating its rise. The downturn had gotten his attention. “People were getting a little queasy,” he acknowledged Wednesday at an event with NASCAR racing champions. ""Over the last few days,"" he began to more seriously consider pausing the additional tariffs, he told reporters later in the day in an Oval Office appearance. One prospect that intrigued him was personally negotiating new trade deals with the countries looking to get out from under the tariffs, the senior administration official said. He'd made up his mind. Sitting with Bessent and Lutnick, he crafted the note announcing the 90-day postponement and ending, for the time being, the biggest economic crisis of his young presidency. “We wrote it from our hearts, right?” Trump said. “It was written as something that I think was very positive for the world and for us, and we don’t want to hurt countries that don’t need to be hurt, and they all want to negotiate.” The day closed with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up nearly 8%, erasing some — but not all — of the post-“Liberation Day” losses. Messy as it all may have seemed, his administration insisted that all is unfolding as planned. ""You have been watching the greatest economic master strategy from an American President in history,"" White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller posted Wednesday afternoon.

370,"Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News  news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time President Donald Trump said Wednesday he was pausing higher targeted tariffs for 90 days for most countries, a stunning reversal in his trade war that has sent markets reeling.   Trump wrote on social media just before 1:30 p.m. that he came to the decision because more than 75 trading partners didn’t retaliate and have reached out to the United States to “discuss” some of the issues he had raised.    The pause didn’t apply to China, which has retaliated — with 84% hikes. Trump instead raised duties for it to 125%, effective immediately.    “Based on the lack of respect that China has shown to the World’s Markets, I am hereby raising the Tariff charged to China by the United States of America to 125%, effective immediately,” he wrote. “At some point, hopefully in the near future, China will realize that the days of ripping off the U.S.A., and other Countries, is no longer sustainable or acceptable.”  But the trade war isn’t exactly over, and the pause didn’t return the world to the time before Trump touched off the global instability; a 10% across-the-board duty will remain. For Canada and Mexico, goods covered by the U.S., Canada and Mexico trade agreement will continue to have no tariffs, while products that aren't exempt under the trade deal will have a 25% tariff. Canadian energy and fertilizer products will have a 10% tariff. It wasn’t immediately clear which countries the pause would cover; the White House wouldn’t say. Earlier Wednesday, the European Union voted to impose fresh retaliatory duties, but they aren’t set to take effect until next week.   And separate tariffs on imported autos, steel and aluminum will remain, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said later — while planned tariffs on items like lumber and pharmaceuticals are still on.  It’s not clear what prompted Trump to change his mind — he appeared to dig in just hours earlier, telling Americans “BE COOL” in a Truth Social post, and he suggested not that long ago that the tariffs could be permanent.   “I did a 90-day pause for the people that didn’t retaliate, because I told them, ‘If you retaliate, we’re going to double it,’” Trump said Wednesday. “And that’s what I did with China, because they did retaliate. So we’ll see how it all works out. I think it’s going to work out amazing.”  But markets have been in stunning turmoil — major stock indexes shed trillions of dollars in value, while alarming signals from the bond market set Wall Street on edge.   When a false-at-the-time headline suggesting Trump would take a 90-day pause shot around the internet Monday, markets briefly surged. And a growing chorus of business leaders and Trump’s allies have come out publicly against the tariffs, including Tesla CEO Elon Musk.  Markets soared on the surprising news Wednesday, with the S&P 500 climbing more than 9%, the tech-heavy Nasdaq closing up more than 12% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average ending nearly 3,000 points higher. Among the big gainers: Tesla stock was up 22%. Despite the gains, all three indexes were down from where they were a month ago and at the start of the year, and some investors questioned what the recent volatility could mean for the U.S. stock market longer-term. ""My portfolio of defensive stocks is green so I don’t begrudge today’s market. But I ask you, would you want to own highly volatile US stocks whose price depends on whether POTUS had a good night’s sleep and woke up the next morning to reverse yesterday’s policies?"" billionaire investor Bill Gross said on X. Goldman Sachs lowered its odds of a recession but said it is still forecasting minimal economic growth and a 45% probability of a recession given the remaining tariffs. Borrowing costs — which had surged early Wednesday as the tariffs took effect — also eased slightly, though not substantially, as some investors may fear a lingering fallout.   Trump has been talking about tariffs as the solution for U.S. economic problems since before he became president; he branded April 2 — when he unveiled the plan — “Liberation Day,” saying it would end decades of the country’s being “looted, pillaged, raped and plundered” by other countries.  The global markets recoiled, and last week $6.6 trillion alone was wiped out. Yet Trump and his allies had doubled down until Wednesday, arguing tariffs were necessary to return manufacturing to the United States and fill the nation’s coffers with trillions of dollars in revenue that could be used to pay down debt or offset tax cuts.   It’s not clear how the White House expects the policies to fuel big gains now. With the lower 10% tariff rate left in place, there will be less incentive for companies to relocate production to the United States and less revenue being generated.  After the news, Bessent sought to make the about-face into a negotiating tactic, insisting it was a way to scare countries to come to the negotiating table by demonstrating how high the United States was going to go.    “President Trump created maximum negotiating leverage for himself,” he said.   It’s unclear how successful the United States will be at negotiating new trade agreements with other countries given Trump’s on-again, off-again threats over the past several months. Previously, he had threatened sweeping tariffs on all imports from Mexico and Canada before he walked most of them back.   And while markets surged higher Wednesday following Trump’s pause, economic uncertainty remains over what will come next in the U.S. trade war with China, which exports more than $400 billion worth of goods to the United States each year.   Under Trump’s new tariffs, the cost for U.S. companies importing goods from China has more than doubled. Those products include everything from toys and sneakers to televisions and iPhones.   U.S. companies exporting their products to China are also caught up in the fray after China increased its tariffs on American goods like agriculture products and machinery. But the White House is downplaying that risk.   “What I am certain of is that what China is doing will affect their economy much more than ours because they have an export-driven, flood-the-world-with-cheap-exports model,” Bessent said.  Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said on X that he sat with Trump as he posted the initial message, adding: “The world is ready to work with President Trump to fix global trade, and China has chosen the opposite direction.”  The Trump administration will now face the daunting task of trying to negotiate dozens of potentially complex and intricate trade deals in a three-month period.  ""That is a huge task to negotiate simultaneously with that many trading partners over that many issues,” said Greta Peisch, who was general counsel for the U.S. trade representative’s office during the Biden administration. “We have tariffs, non-tariff barriers, other non-trade related matters, all of those issues can get quite complicated quite quickly. Even with just a handful of trading partners, that would be a large undertaking."" Rob Wile is a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist covering breaking business stories for NBCNews.com.

10,"President Donald Trump and his billionaire adviser Elon Musk have fanned the flames of a baseless rumor about America’s gold reserves at least a dozen times since mid-February.

The conspiracy theory, alleging without evidence that someone might have stolen the gold reserves from Fort Knox, Kentucky, has circulated for decades, but it seems to have first appeared on the Trump administration’s radar after far-right financial blog Zero Hedge tagged Musk in a post about the idea on X.

Since then, Musk and Trump have shared the idea and teased plans for a personal inspection of the fortress that holds the government’s gold bars.

Despite raising alarm and fueling conspiracy chatter online and offline, there is no evidence that any gold is missing, and there’s no indication that Musk or Trump has taken any concrete steps toward visiting Fort Knox. A White House spokesperson declined to comment on their plans, saying in an email: “No announcements at this time.”

The rumor immediately found an audience, including gold obsessives who have nurtured conspiracy theories about government gold reserves for more than 50 years. Many of them stubbornly reject the evidence that Fort Knox is secure, and they interpret its security measures as evidence that the government is hiding something.

Aaron Klein, the chair of economic studies at the Brookings Institution, said the statements by Musk and Trump fit a pattern of the two men trying to sow doubt in traditional institutions.

“The gold has come to have a symbolic value of the faith in the U.S. government’s fundamental position,” said Klein, who served in the Obama Treasury Department.

“Questioning the gold as having been ‘lost’ or ‘stolen’ is part of a series of actions that undermine confidence in America,” he added. “Why somebody who purports to be trying to restore America would want to undermine its confidence is confusing.”

Trump and Musk are tapping into a classic but obscure rumor with a long history: People have recycled the claim that Fort Knox is empty on a semiregular basis, sometimes paired with vague anti-government vibes.

“It comes up periodically, and it has for decades,” said Philip Diehl, a former director of the U.S. Mint, which oversees the gold storage. “Eventually, the pressure builds, and the president sends somebody in to take a look.”

In 1974, after a gadfly author named Peter Beter charged that unnamed powerful interests had looted Fort Knox, the rumor spread so widely that the U.S. Mint decided to invite lawmakers and journalists for a tour. And in 2011, then-Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, who favored abolishing the Federal Reserve and returning to a gold-based currency system, held a congressional hearing on whether the Fort Knox gold was secure. Treasury officials from both Republican and Democratic administrations have repeatedly said the gold is fine, and in 2017, Trump’s treasury secretary at the time, Steven Mnuchin, visited the Kentucky fortress and came away satisfied.

“The gold was there when I visited it. I hope nobody’s moved it. I’m sure they haven’t,” Mnuchin, who isn’t serving in Trump’s second administration, told CNBC in February.

Trump’s current treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, told podcast host Dan O’Donnell in February: “All the gold is present and accounted for.”

No visit has materialized in the nearly two months since then, and it’s not clear why.

Paul, the former congressman, said he’s not sure Musk and Trump will follow through. He has criticized Trump at times, including for bombing Yemen last month.

“They have other things to deal with. They have to plan the bombing in Yemen, and they have to deal with the oil in Syria. They have to stop a war on Ukraine, and so the gold they can forget about for a while. They’ll avoid it if they see an advantage to it. So that is why people don’t trust governments,” he said.

Paul said he believes past audits haven’t been thorough enough. He wants Trump and Musk to perform lab tests known as assays to determine the exact composition of the gold bars.

The gold reserve used to have a practical purpose: to allow foreign governments to swap their dollars for gold. But President Richard Nixon ended the practice in 1971. Now, its value is mainly symbolic of U.S. wealth, and other countries, such as China, have recently sought to build up their own reserves.

The gold theft rumors have come in several varieties, all without evidence, among them that European bankers took the gold or that the Rockefeller banking family did.

Certain conspiracy theories tend to pop up repeatedly over time, said Bret Schafer, a senior fellow who studies disinformation at the German Marshall Fund, a nonprofit organization that works to strengthen the U.S.-Europe alliance. Allegedly government-made bioweapons are one such recurring conspiracy theory, he said, and the Fort Knox gold rumor is another.

“These rumors work best when they’re built up over time. It’s like Hollywood sequels: You build off the original,” he said. And in both cases, he added, “you just get a lot of retreads.”

Fort Knox has appeared in movies that add to its allure. A scheme involving the facility is a major plot point in the 1964 James Bond film “Goldfinger,” underscoring the belief that Fort Knox could be a tempting target.

And unlike some internet-era hoaxes, the Fort Knox rumors originated in an age when conspiracy theories spread by less efficient means, not on X, whose owner, Musk, has 218 million listed followers.

“It precedes the social media digital age, but now we’re in an environment where things can pop from the corners of ‘conspiracy land’ to policy action in a matter of hours, because all of you have to do is land on Musk’s radar,” Schafer said.

Formally known as the U.S. Bullion Depository, the gold reserve site is next to the Army base Fort Knox. It was built in 1936, and President Franklin Roosevelt was the only visitor until the tour for media and members of Congress in 1974.

The tour 51 years ago yielded newspaper headlines such as one in The New York Times: “Visitors Get a Peek at Fort Knox Gold—It’s There.”

The Treasury Department’s nonpartisan inspector general audits the gold every year, said Eric Thorson, a former inspector general who’s now retired. He said that he sent teams of about three people every year and that he went personally once in 2011.

“There is absolutely zero doubt the gold is there,” he said.

“I’m a former Air Force pilot. I’ve been on bases with nuclear weapons, and this place has every bit the security that any nuclear base has,” he added. “The security is unbelievable. Nobody’s going to go in there and take it.”

Zero Hedge, a far-right financial blog and social media brand that appears to have first alerted Musk to the idea, frequently posts about gold as an investment. It tweeted in 2011 about Paul’s Fort Knox concerns and in 2017 about Mnuchin’s Fort Knox visit. Sometimes, accounts on X respond to Zero Hedge posts with commentary about Fort Knox.

Then, on Feb. 15, Zero Hedge posted a suggestion on X and tagged Musk directly.

“It would be great if @elonmusk could take a look inside Fort Knox just to make sure the 4,580 tons of US gold is there. Last time anyone looked was 50 years ago in 1974,” the account posted.

The second sentence is wrong, according to Thorson, but the post got the attention of Musk and others. It had 3.3 million views as of Friday.

“Surely it’s reviewed at least every year?” Musk responded to the post. Zero Hedge replied, repeating the falsehood that the gold isn’t reviewed every year.

Google Trends data shows that after the interaction, web searches for the term “Fort Knox” hit their highest level since Google began collecting data in 2004 and kept rising for several days.

On Feb. 16, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., Ron Paul’s son, chimed in. He repeated the inaccuracy that the gold isn’t reviewed annually and said, “Let’s do it.”

Zero Hedge has often faced restrictions on tech platforms for violating terms of service, including publishing allegedly derogatory material. In 2022, U.S. intelligence officials accused the site of amplifying Russian propaganda, a claim it denied. But under Musk’s ownership of X, Zero Hedge has thrived, growing its follower count from 1.5 million to 2.1 million.

Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones also discussed the Fort Knox rumor on his podcast. He said he supported Musk’s looking into Fort Knox while acknowledging that he heard the same rumor as a child more than 40 years ago. Jones’ sponsors and advertisers have for years included gold retailers.

Soon, Musk and Trump were fueling the uncertainty. On Feb. 17, Musk posted on X about the gold: “Maybe it’s there, maybe it’s not.” He spoke about it on Joe Rogan’s podcast and at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference, often mixing the conspiracy theory with attempts at humor.

“We want to go see it and just make sure somebody didn’t spray-paint some lead or something, you know?” Musk said at CPAC on Feb. 20.

Musk reiterated his intention to inspect the goal as recently as March 30 at a town hall-style event in Wisconsin, after an unidentified audience member raised the subject. “You were going to go check our gold, and I’m worried about the Democrats and Joe Biden’s last administration with the money not being there,” the audience member said.

“Did you get blocked? Or are you still able to check that?” he asked.

“That’s up to the president, of course, but I think it would be awesome to livestream Fort Knox,” Musk responded. “Hopefully it looks really cool.”

Trump mentioned it to reporters several times, including in the Oval Office on Feb. 24. He has a longtime fascination with gold, with a golden escalator at one of his New York towers and a chocolate bar wrapped in gold foil for sale on his website for $86.

“We’re actually going to Fort Knox to see if the gold is there, because maybe somebody stole the gold, tons of gold,” Trump said, without citing any evidence.

The gold facility doesn’t offer tours, and its website is blunt: “No visitors are permitted in the facility.” But the Treasury Department answers to the president and would presumably let him in. The department didn’t respond to requests for comment.

The U.S. Mint says Fort Knox holds about 147.3 million ounces of gold currently, or about half the Treasury’s total gold reserves. That’s worth about $450 billion at the current market price — which is both a massive fortune and not enough to cover what the federal government spends in a single month.

Diehl, who was director of the U.S. Mint in the 1990s, said there’s a lot of overlap between Trump’s voting base and people who invest in metals such as gold or commemorative coins.

“Talking about gold speaks directly to his base,” said Diehl, who’s now the president of U.S. Money Reserve, a gold retailer.

Diehl said he’s certain the Fort Knox gold is secure, and yet he said he anticipates a surprise announcement of some kind by Trump, just given his approaching to governing: maybe selling the gold, maybe buying more, maybe something else entirely.

The price of gold soared to record highs in recent days amid concerns about Trump’s trade wars before they fell again along with other asset prices since last week’s tariff announcement. It’s unclear whether Musk or Trump has any personal gold holdings.

Thorson, the retired Treasury Department inspector general, said he believes the Fort Knox rumors are politically useful for Trump and Musk.

“What is probably happening here is taking any chance to make the American public feel that they’re being taken advantage of and that they’re a victim,” he said. Now, he said, Trump and Musk can position themselves as saviors in the mold of Trump’s 2016 statement “I alone can fix it.”

And the longer the visit doesn’t happen, the more useful the rumors become for anyone who benefits from them.

“If the intent is to undermine the financial system, you don’t actually want anyone to go there and look,” said Schafer, of the German Marshall Fund."
371,"Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News  news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time HONG KONG — The increasingly vicious trade war between Washington and Beijing took another turn Wednesday when China imposed an additional 50% tariff on imports from the U.S., hiking its levies on American imports to 84%. The tit-for-tat escalation came hours after President Donald Trump’s 104% tariffs on Chinese imports went into effect, including 50% Trump added Monday. Later Wednesday, Trump increased the overall U.S. tariff on Chinese goods to 125%, even as he paused higher targeted tariffs on other countries for 90 days while keeping a 10% baseline tariff in place for all countries. Trump’s 50% tariff is a “mistake upon another mistake,” China’s Customs Tariff Commission said in a statement earlier Wednesday, adding that the world’s two biggest economies should “resolve differences through equal dialogue based on mutual respect.”  The effect of China’s 84% tariff may be somewhat limited because China imports only about $160 billion a year in U.S. goods compared with the more than $400 billion in goods it exports to the U.S. “I don’t think they can match in the economic realm, because the relationship is so unbalanced,” said Rick Waters, the Singapore-based director of the Carnegie China think tank. “So what they tend to do is move into adjacent realms to exact a price.”  Here's a look at some of the other measures China might take.  China could greatly increase tariffs on U.S. agricultural products, or even stop importing them completely. “I think there’s a very high chance that China will stop agricultural imports from the U.S. altogether,” said Tianchen Xu, a Beijing-based economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit, a financial forecasting service. “It’s a weapon targeting Trump’s supporter base,” he added.  Soybeans, which are crushed to make protein-rich animal feed ingredients and vegetable oils, have been at the heart of the U.S.-China trade dispute for some time. U.S. exports of soybeans to China fell 75% after China imposed a retaliatory 25% tariff on them in 2018, during Trump’s first-term trade war with Beijing. The Trump administration announced $12 billion in subsidies for farmers to offset the impact, and it has again promised to step in if the latest round of tariffs hurts the industry further. China could also put further restrictions on American poultry products, having announced an import ban on two U.S. companies last week. China, which frequently trades places with North America as the world’s largest box office, is a crucial market for Hollywood films. Though China has an annual quota for the number of foreign movies that can appear in its theaters, it could ban Hollywood films altogether. American movies have already been declining in popularity in recent years as U.S.-China trade tensions have escalated. There were no Hollywood films among China’s 10 highest-grossing movies in 2023, in stark contrast to 2012, when seven of the top 10 highest-grossing movies were U.S.-made, according to Maoyan, a Chinese movie-ticketing and data platform.  The U.S. has a large trade deficit with China in goods, but it comes out ahead when it comes to services such as finance, consulting and law. U.S. data lists China as its fifth-largest export market for services, according to a report by China’s State Council released Wednesday. China could target the U.S. services sector, for example, by excluding American companies from government procurement processes or restricting their cooperation with Chinese firms. The U.S. has long accused China of stealing its intellectual property. But Beijing also has its own growing intellectual property interests, and it could investigate U.S. companies in China in an effort to protect them. China and the U.S. have made progress on stemming the international flow of precursor ingredients for fentanyl, some of which originate in China and are then processed into the deadly opioid in countries such as Mexico before being smuggled into the U.S.  But China could bring that cooperation to a halt in response to Trump’s tariffs. “Out of humanitarian considerations, China has provided various forms of assistance to the U.S.,” Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said last month. “The U.S. should not repay goodwill with hostility.” Waters said it would be “counterproductive” for China to suspend cooperation on fentanyl. “It’s just going to cement narratives in the U.S. that they’re weaponizing drugs against us,” he said.

373,"Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News  news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time A bipartisan team of freshman senators who went through some of 2024’s biggest battleground races is introducing a bill Wednesday to give President Donald Trump’s administration the power to stop investments from Chinese companies in the U.S. Sens. Bernie Moreno, R-Ohio; Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich.; and Tim Sheehy, R-Mont., are sponsoring the Providing Rigorous Oversight Through Evaluation of Concerning Transactions Act (or PROTECT Act), which would give the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States new authority to stop both entirely new foreign investment projects in the U.S. and foreign investments in existing facilities. The bill would “require the review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States of greenfield and brownfield investments by foreign countries of concern.” The legislation comes after the White House, in a February memo, asked for Congress to “strengthen” CFIUS’ ability to “restrict foreign adversary access to United States talent and operations in sensitive technologies (especially artificial intelligence).” In an interview, Moreno said Congress needs to give Trump “maximum negotiating leverage” to deal with China, and that this legislation contributes to that goal. ""We all went through extremely expensive, extremely tough races,"" Moreno said of the trio of senators introducing the legislation. ""And I think we’re probably the most in tune with what voters are thinking right now."" In a statement, Slotkin described the need for the legislation in national security terms, pointing to the importance of keeping “sensitive American land” out of Chinese, Iranian or North Korean control. “To address that risk, this bipartisan bill builds on my work in the U.S. House and gives more authority to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. to examine a broader set of transactions,” she said. “That means we can stop land purchases that pose an actual risk to our national security.” The senators introduced the legislation the same day Trump’s 104% total tariff on China went into effect — and he raised it to 125% later Wednesday. Meanwhile, China retaliated with a new 84% tariff on U.S. imports. Moreno promoted Trump’s actions and said the senators’ legislation is part of a broader effort to counter China, describing tariffs as “the beginning.” “You had 50 years where China was allowed into the World Trade Organization, they were given most favored nation trading status, and there was a very naive or corrupt, depending on which individual you’re talking about, view that this would be good for America,” Moreno said. “It has been catastrophically bad. We’ve now created a monster.” Last week, Bloomberg reported that China took steps to restrict Chinese companies from investing in the U.S. following Trump's tariff announcement, according to people familiar with the move. “Unfortunately, there’s a strategic adversary, and we have to reset that relationship in a meaningful way,” he continued, adding, “We don’t want to go to war with China, that’s not the goal here. But we have to stop being suckers, as President Trump talks about.” Trump’s global tariffs went into effect Wednesday, as some administration officials suggest there are deals to be made with trading partners while others have said nothing will change the direction of Trump’s tariff agenda. “Well that’s going to be up to President Trump, certainly,” Moreno said. “You hear from his public statements that he’s willing and open to listen to proposals. But obviously, China is a separate situation where we have over $1 trillion in debt.” Allan Smith is a political reporter for NBC News. © 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"
374,"Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News  news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time In the wake of President Donald Trump’s announcement Wednesday afternoon that he was pausing country-by-country tariffs by 90 days, some experts — as well as critics of Trump and social media users — are raising questions about a statement he posted earlier in the day that may have indicated the massive sell-off in stocks in recent days was coming to an end.   Not long after trading opened at 9:30 a.m. Wednesday, Trump took to his Truth Social platform and wrote: “BE COOL! Everything is going to work out well. The USA will be bigger and better than ever before!” Four minutes later, he wrote: “THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!! DJT” Just before 1:30 p.m., Trump announced the pause, sending stocks soaring. The tech-heavy Nasdaq index had its biggest one-day gain since 2008, rising nearly 12%, while the S&P 500 climbed 9.5% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 8%, or about 2,800 points.  Trump could have been generally urging people to buy into the market while prices were relatively low. That was the response Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick gave when he was asked about the posts Wednesday evening on CNBC. “Donald Trump understands that … America is the greatest country, all right? We are the greatest country, and we have the capacity for incredible greatness. But someone needs to take the shackles off.” But on social media, some users raised the prospect — without evidence — of market manipulation, while others began referring to the market’s sharp turn upward as the “Trump Pump.”    There is no evidence to suggest that Trump was seeking to manipulate markets or that he or any of his advisers acted on inside information For Richard Painter, chief ethics lawyer for former President George W. Bush, who now teaches government ethics and security regulation at the University of Minnesota’s law school, the morning posts, at a minimum, leave Trump open to questions about his intentions.   “This is a scenario that could expose the president to accusations that he engaged in market manipulation,” Painter said.  Even before he’d been sworn in for his second term, Trump faced insider-trading criticisms amid the launch of his $TRUMP meme coin. In that incident, the Trump Organization was explicit that a group of investors who were helping launch the coin stood to benefit from its release assuming its price went up. Still, reports showed other investors reaping outsized profits from the launch, including one crypto-wallet owner or owners who earned $109 million, according to a New York Times analysis. Some Democrats were quick to blast Trump’s actions on Wednesday. ""An insider trading scandal is brewing,"" Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., posted on X. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., told NBC News that the Trump administration is “replete with grifters” and that “corruption is its middle name.”  “Insider trading is a real threat, and I hope there will be a surge of penetrating investigations into the potential for manipulation and insider trading of securities,” Blumenthal said, “since the knowledge of what Trump’s plans have been and may be is widely spread.” Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif. — a frequent object of Trump’s scorn — also suggested an inquiry was warranted. “Trump is creating giant market fluctuations with his on-again, off-again tariffs,” Schiff wrote on social media. “These constant gyrations in policy provide dangerous opportunities for insider trading. Who in the administration knew about Trump’s latest tariff flip flop ahead of time? Did anyone buy or sell  stocks, and profit at the public’s expense? I’m writing to the White House — the public has a right to know.” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., pointed to the upcoming May 15 deadline for members of Congress to submit their financial disclosure reports, writing on X, ""Any member of Congress who purchased stocks in the last 48 hours should probably disclose that now. I’ve been hearing some interesting chatter on the floor."" A White House spokesman rejected the Democrats’ assertions. “It is the responsibility of the President of the United States to reassure the markets and Americans about their economic security in the face of nonstop media fearmongering,” White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement. “Instead of grasping at straws to try landing a punch on President Trump, Democrats should focus on working with the administration to restore American Greatness.” A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment. The Securities and Exchange Commission did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Painter said the incident could result in investigations “into who knew what and when before [Trump] announced he was going to postpone the tariffs on all the countries except for China.” “This was a terrible idea to make those posts,” Painter said of Trump’s suggestion that it was “a great time to buy.”  Painter further admonished Trump, saying, “I would hope that he would focus on doing his job — and try to calm the markets and have a predictable trade policy and let the markets do their thing without the White House giving what appears to be investment advice.” Rob Wile is a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist covering breaking business stories for NBCNews.com. © 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

387,"Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News  news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton’s attempt to topple Republican Sen. John Cornyn in a Senate primary next year kicks off one of the most intense contests of the 2026 elections — a GOP-versus-GOP battle between two men who have been sparring for years and vying for President Donald Trump’s attention.   Cornyn is a fixture of the Republican Party in Texas, serving in its highest offices for more than 30 years and becoming a key voice on Capitol Hill. Paxton, the third-term attorney general who survived a bipartisan impeachment last year in part thanks to support from Trump and conservative activist allies, believes there’s an opening to cut the incumbent down from the right.  Now, both sides are aligning themselves with Trump amid the possibility of an endorsement that could tip the primary.  Whether one comes or not, one thing is clear. “This is gonna be the nastiest race in the modern era of Texas politics, period,” former Travis County GOP chairman Matt Mackowiak said.   Paxton immediately attacked Cornyn for having “turned his back on President Trump,” pointing to comments Cornyn made in 2023 about Trump’s indictment over his handling of classified documents, as well as the senator’s comments that he didn’t think Trump “could win the presidency” after Trump was found liable for sexual abuse in a civil case that same year. Paxton has also targeted Cornyn over his votes on issues including guns and immigration to try to argue that he is more aligned with conservative values. “While John was criticizing Trump and suggesting he shouldn’t run, I was at Mar-a-Lago” for Trump’s presidential announcement speech, Paxton told “The Mark Davis Show” in Dallas.   ""If he had the record of [Texas GOP Sen.] Ted Cruz, would I be here? Absolutely not,"" Paxton continued. ""This isn’t about what he’s saying and the love he suddenly has for President Trump and the love he has for all of our issues now. This isn’t about that love. I don’t believe that love, I believe in action."" Cornyn, though, also made an appeal to Trump’s interests, telling reporters at the Capitol on Wednesday that Paxton’s Senate bid is a “con man’s vanity project.”   “The biggest potential loser is President Trump’s agenda,” Cornyn said of the primary challenge.  “Mr. Paxton has a checkered background, he is a con man and a fraud, and I think the people of Texas know that, but this is what will be litigated during the course of this campaign. I am not going to turn over the Senate seat that was once held by Sam Houston to someone like him,” he added, a reference to the 2023 impeachment trial of Paxton, after which he survived a conviction vote in the state Senate.    “It’s unclear to me exactly what is motivating Mr. Paxton other than vanity and personal ambition,” Cornyn continued.  In the months before Paxton jumped in — and in the hours since — Cornyn has made clear he’s hugging Trump as tight as he can. He posted on X a photo of him reading Trump’s “The Art of the Deal” and called it “recommended” reading; he took to the Senate floor to defend Trump aide and billionaire Elon Musk (whose businesses have a significant footprint in Texas) after protests at Tesla dealerships; and he has been framing himself as one of Trump’s top allies in the Senate.   The roots of this clash between another establishment-insurgent pair of Republicans run deep, part of a decade-plus battle within the Texas GOP that has ousted legislative leaders, fueled Cruz's rise, fanned the flames of Paxton’s impeachment, and led to proxy wars up and down the ballot.   Paxton had been telegraphing a run against Cornyn from the right for more than a year. In early 2024, Paxton lambasted the senator as “anti-Trump [and] anti-gun” in a post on X, adding that “Texans deserve another conservative Senator.”   Cornyn reposted the message and replied: “Hard to run from prison, Ken,” a reference to the investigations that led to the impeachment trial. (The Associated Press reported this month that the Justice Department decided last year not to prosecute Paxton over corruption allegations.)  Brendan Steinhauser, a longtime GOP consultant who served as Cornyn’s campaign manager in the past but is unaffiliated in this race, told NBC News it’s no surprise to see Cornyn campaign with an eye on Trump.   “If you’re Senator Cornyn, you’re going to be campaigning on all the ways that you have supported and worked with the president, you’re going to talk about all the policies where you align, you’re going to talk about helping to get all of his judicial nominees through,” he said.  While a potential endorsement from Trump remains a major question, Cornyn does have support from Senate Republicans. Sen. Tim Scott, of South Carolina, who chairs the National Republican Senatorial Committee, has made his case for Cornyn to White House officials. Scott also told Rep. Wesley Hunt, R-Texas, who has also been weighing a Senate run, that the NRSC is behind Cornyn, according to a source familiar with the discussions.   “John Cornyn is a leader who delivers on President Trump’s agenda and for the people of Texas in the U.S. Senate,” Scott said in a statement to NBC News. “He’s a proven fighter, man of faith and essential part of the Republican Senate Majority.”   Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., has also been publicly backing Cornyn and recently told CNN he was hopeful Trump would back Cornyn in the race.   Asked Wednesday if he has personally asked Trump to endorse Cornyn, Thune told reporters at the Capitol: “Well, we’re having conversations about all of the races on the map. When we have anything to report, we’ll let you know.”  Senate Leadership Fund, the main GOP super PAC involved in Senate races, which is aligned with Republican leadership, indicated it is also in Cornyn's corner. ""Leader John Thune, NRSC Chairman Tim Scott, and many of their colleagues have expressed great admiration and support for Senator John Cornyn and his years of service to the people of Texas,"" SLF Chairman Cory Gardner, a former senator from Colorado, said in a statement to NBC News. ""The Senate Leadership Fund fully intends on seeing him reelected next November."" Mackowiak, a longtime Texas political consultant, told NBC News that he sees Paxton’s early announcement as an indication of two things: The attorney general sees an opening, but he knows he needs time to raise the money required to combat Cornyn and the power of incumbency.   “Paxton’s never run a race this complicated, this expensive against someone as accomplished and serious as John Cornyn,"" he said. ""John Cornyn has never been challenged by someone that has the statewide profile and grassroots enthusiasm Paxton has.""  But Mackowiak argued that while Paxton has sought to go on offense early, that dynamic may not stick, and that the events that led to Paxton’s impeachment trial (which divided Republicans in the state) will likely be relitigated.   “He is going to be playing a lot more defense than he even understands. I think because he got through impeachment, these issues are behind him. They’re not,” he said.   One potential wrinkle, particularly if Hunt or another Republican decides to jump in, is Texas’ runoff rules. If no candidate wins the majority of the vote in the primary, the top two move on to a one-on-one runoff election.   Cornyn has never lost an election in Texas, and he’s never been forced to a runoff by any of his opponents (who have largely challenged him from the right). But the prospect of a split field leading to a runoff is another complicating factor, with both Mackowiak and Steinhauser noting that runoff electorates typically favor the candidate with more grassroots conservative support.  The Texas race could have broader implications for the fight for the Senate next year as Republicans look to defend their slim majority.    Democrats need to net three seats to take control of the Senate, but they face an uphill battle with a short list of targets. Just one Republican — Maine’s Susan Collins — is running in a state that former Vice President Kamala Harris carried in November. Republicans, meanwhile, are looking to grow their majority by targeting Democratic-held seats in battleground states.  But Cornyn said a competitive election in Texas could put a strain on Republicans nationally by diverting money away from other key battlegrounds.   “We’re going to end up spending hundreds of millions of dollars, potentially, on this race in Texas, because we can’t lose the seat in Texas,” said Cornyn, a former NRSC chairman. “And that is money that can’t be used in places like Michigan, New Hampshire and Georgia in the midterm elections.”  Democrats have long coveted the idea of flipping Texas, with former Rep. Beto O’Rourke coming close to defeating Cruz in the blue wave year of 2018. But Trump expanded his margin last year in Texas compared to 2020, carrying Texas by 14 percentage points as Cruz defeated former Democratic Rep. Colin Allred by 9 points.  Allred told The Dallas Morning News last month that he is “seriously considering” another run for Senate against Cornyn. Cruz, meanwhile, told reporters Wednesday that he is staying neutral in this year’s Senate primary, saying both Paxton and Cornyn are friends.   “I have worked closely with both of them. I respect them both,” Cruz said. “And I trust the voters of Texas to make that decision.”  A divisive GOP primary could play into Democrats’ hands — especially if Paxton is the nominee. In the meantime, Democrats are watching the GOP primary process play out in Texas and other states. Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee spokesperson Maeve Coyle noted that former New Hampshire GOP Gov. Chris Sununu announced Tuesday that he would not be running for that state’s open Senate seat.   “As Republicans face a nasty primary in Texas and an embarrassing recruitment failure in New Hampshire — coupled with a building midterm backlash across the map driven by their threats to Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and their push to spike costs for families — Democrats will look for every opportunity to put them on defense,” Coyle said.

147,"President Donald Trump and his billionaire adviser Elon Musk have fanned the flames of a baseless rumor about America’s gold reserves at least a dozen times since mid-February.

The conspiracy theory, alleging without evidence that someone might have stolen the gold reserves from Fort Knox, Kentucky, has circulated for decades, but it seems to have first appeared on the Trump administration’s radar after far-right financial blog Zero Hedge tagged Musk in a post about the idea on X.

Since then, Musk and Trump have shared the idea and teased plans for a personal inspection of the fortress that holds the government’s gold bars.

Despite raising alarm and fueling conspiracy chatter online and offline, there is no evidence that any gold is missing, and there’s no indication that Musk or Trump has taken any concrete steps toward visiting Fort Knox. A White House spokesperson declined to comment on their plans, saying in an email: “No announcements at this time.”

The rumor immediately found an audience, including gold obsessives who have nurtured conspiracy theories about government gold reserves for more than 50 years. Many of them stubbornly reject the evidence that Fort Knox is secure, and they interpret its security measures as evidence that the government is hiding something.

Aaron Klein, the chair of economic studies at the Brookings Institution, said the statements by Musk and Trump fit a pattern of the two men trying to sow doubt in traditional institutions.

“The gold has come to have a symbolic value of the faith in the U.S. government’s fundamental position,” said Klein, who served in the Obama Treasury Department.

“Questioning the gold as having been ‘lost’ or ‘stolen’ is part of a series of actions that undermine confidence in America,” he added. “Why somebody who purports to be trying to restore America would want to undermine its confidence is confusing.”

Trump and Musk are tapping into a classic but obscure rumor with a long history: People have recycled the claim that Fort Knox is empty on a semiregular basis, sometimes paired with vague anti-government vibes.

“It comes up periodically, and it has for decades,” said Philip Diehl, a former director of the U.S. Mint, which oversees the gold storage. “Eventually, the pressure builds, and the president sends somebody in to take a look.”

In 1974, after a gadfly author named Peter Beter charged that unnamed powerful interests had looted Fort Knox, the rumor spread so widely that the U.S. Mint decided to invite lawmakers and journalists for a tour. And in 2011, then-Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, who favored abolishing the Federal Reserve and returning to a gold-based currency system, held a congressional hearing on whether the Fort Knox gold was secure. Treasury officials from both Republican and Democratic administrations have repeatedly said the gold is fine, and in 2017, Trump’s treasury secretary at the time, Steven Mnuchin, visited the Kentucky fortress and came away satisfied.

“The gold was there when I visited it. I hope nobody’s moved it. I’m sure they haven’t,” Mnuchin, who isn’t serving in Trump’s second administration, told CNBC in February.

Trump’s current treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, told podcast host Dan O’Donnell in February: “All the gold is present and accounted for.”

No visit has materialized in the nearly two months since then, and it’s not clear why.

Paul, the former congressman, said he’s not sure Musk and Trump will follow through. He has criticized Trump at times, including for bombing Yemen last month.

“They have other things to deal with. They have to plan the bombing in Yemen, and they have to deal with the oil in Syria. They have to stop a war on Ukraine, and so the gold they can forget about for a while. They’ll avoid it if they see an advantage to it. So that is why people don’t trust governments,” he said.

Paul said he believes past audits haven’t been thorough enough. He wants Trump and Musk to perform lab tests known as assays to determine the exact composition of the gold bars.

The gold reserve used to have a practical purpose: to allow foreign governments to swap their dollars for gold. But President Richard Nixon ended the practice in 1971. Now, its value is mainly symbolic of U.S. wealth, and other countries, such as China, have recently sought to build up their own reserves.

The gold theft rumors have come in several varieties, all without evidence, among them that European bankers took the gold or that the Rockefeller banking family did.

Certain conspiracy theories tend to pop up repeatedly over time, said Bret Schafer, a senior fellow who studies disinformation at the German Marshall Fund, a nonprofit organization that works to strengthen the U.S.-Europe alliance. Allegedly government-made bioweapons are one such recurring conspiracy theory, he said, and the Fort Knox gold rumor is another.

“These rumors work best when they’re built up over time. It’s like Hollywood sequels: You build off the original,” he said. And in both cases, he added, “you just get a lot of retreads.”

Fort Knox has appeared in movies that add to its allure. A scheme involving the facility is a major plot point in the 1964 James Bond film “Goldfinger,” underscoring the belief that Fort Knox could be a tempting target.

And unlike some internet-era hoaxes, the Fort Knox rumors originated in an age when conspiracy theories spread by less efficient means, not on X, whose owner, Musk, has 218 million listed followers.

“It precedes the social media digital age, but now we’re in an environment where things can pop from the corners of ‘conspiracy land’ to policy action in a matter of hours, because all of you have to do is land on Musk’s radar,” Schafer said.

Formally known as the U.S. Bullion Depository, the gold reserve site is next to the Army base Fort Knox. It was built in 1936, and President Franklin Roosevelt was the only visitor until the tour for media and members of Congress in 1974.

The tour 51 years ago yielded newspaper headlines such as one in The New York Times: “Visitors Get a Peek at Fort Knox Gold—It’s There.”

The Treasury Department’s nonpartisan inspector general audits the gold every year, said Eric Thorson, a former inspector general who’s now retired. He said that he sent teams of about three people every year and that he went personally once in 2011.

“There is absolutely zero doubt the gold is there,” he said.

“I’m a former Air Force pilot. I’ve been on bases with nuclear weapons, and this place has every bit the security that any nuclear base has,” he added. “The security is unbelievable. Nobody’s going to go in there and take it.”

Zero Hedge, a far-right financial blog and social media brand that appears to have first alerted Musk to the idea, frequently posts about gold as an investment. It tweeted in 2011 about Paul’s Fort Knox concerns and in 2017 about Mnuchin’s Fort Knox visit. Sometimes, accounts on X respond to Zero Hedge posts with commentary about Fort Knox.

Then, on Feb. 15, Zero Hedge posted a suggestion on X and tagged Musk directly.

“It would be great if @elonmusk could take a look inside Fort Knox just to make sure the 4,580 tons of US gold is there. Last time anyone looked was 50 years ago in 1974,” the account posted.

The second sentence is wrong, according to Thorson, but the post got the attention of Musk and others. It had 3.3 million views as of Friday.

“Surely it’s reviewed at least every year?” Musk responded to the post. Zero Hedge replied, repeating the falsehood that the gold isn’t reviewed every year.

Google Trends data shows that after the interaction, web searches for the term “Fort Knox” hit their highest level since Google began collecting data in 2004 and kept rising for several days.

On Feb. 16, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., Ron Paul’s son, chimed in. He repeated the inaccuracy that the gold isn’t reviewed annually and said, “Let’s do it.”

Zero Hedge has often faced restrictions on tech platforms for violating terms of service, including publishing allegedly derogatory material. In 2022, U.S. intelligence officials accused the site of amplifying Russian propaganda, a claim it denied. But under Musk’s ownership of X, Zero Hedge has thrived, growing its follower count from 1.5 million to 2.1 million.

Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones also discussed the Fort Knox rumor on his podcast. He said he supported Musk’s looking into Fort Knox while acknowledging that he heard the same rumor as a child more than 40 years ago. Jones’ sponsors and advertisers have for years included gold retailers.

Soon, Musk and Trump were fueling the uncertainty. On Feb. 17, Musk posted on X about the gold: “Maybe it’s there, maybe it’s not.” He spoke about it on Joe Rogan’s podcast and at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference, often mixing the conspiracy theory with attempts at humor.

“We want to go see it and just make sure somebody didn’t spray-paint some lead or something, you know?” Musk said at CPAC on Feb. 20.

Musk reiterated his intention to inspect the goal as recently as March 30 at a town hall-style event in Wisconsin, after an unidentified audience member raised the subject. “You were going to go check our gold, and I’m worried about the Democrats and Joe Biden’s last administration with the money not being there,” the audience member said.

“Did you get blocked? Or are you still able to check that?” he asked.

“That’s up to the president, of course, but I think it would be awesome to livestream Fort Knox,” Musk responded. “Hopefully it looks really cool.”

Trump mentioned it to reporters several times, including in the Oval Office on Feb. 24. He has a longtime fascination with gold, with a golden escalator at one of his New York towers and a chocolate bar wrapped in gold foil for sale on his website for $86.

“We’re actually going to Fort Knox to see if the gold is there, because maybe somebody stole the gold, tons of gold,” Trump said, without citing any evidence.

The gold facility doesn’t offer tours, and its website is blunt: “No visitors are permitted in the facility.” But the Treasury Department answers to the president and would presumably let him in. The department didn’t respond to requests for comment.

The U.S. Mint says Fort Knox holds about 147.3 million ounces of gold currently, or about half the Treasury’s total gold reserves. That’s worth about $450 billion at the current market price — which is both a massive fortune and not enough to cover what the federal government spends in a single month.

Diehl, who was director of the U.S. Mint in the 1990s, said there’s a lot of overlap between Trump’s voting base and people who invest in metals such as gold or commemorative coins.

“Talking about gold speaks directly to his base,” said Diehl, who’s now the president of U.S. Money Reserve, a gold retailer.

Diehl said he’s certain the Fort Knox gold is secure, and yet he said he anticipates a surprise announcement of some kind by Trump, just given his approaching to governing: maybe selling the gold, maybe buying more, maybe something else entirely.

The price of gold soared to record highs in recent days amid concerns about Trump’s trade wars before they fell again along with other asset prices since last week’s tariff announcement. It’s unclear whether Musk or Trump has any personal gold holdings.

Thorson, the retired Treasury Department inspector general, said he believes the Fort Knox rumors are politically useful for Trump and Musk.

“What is probably happening here is taking any chance to make the American public feel that they’re being taken advantage of and that they’re a victim,” he said. Now, he said, Trump and Musk can position themselves as saviors in the mold of Trump’s 2016 statement “I alone can fix it.”

And the longer the visit doesn’t happen, the more useful the rumors become for anyone who benefits from them.

“If the intent is to undermine the financial system, you don’t actually want anyone to go there and look,” said Schafer, of the German Marshall Fund."
628,"Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News  news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time HONG KONG — The increasingly vicious trade war between Washington and Beijing took another turn Wednesday when China imposed an additional 50% tariff on imports from the U.S., hiking its levies on American imports to 84%. The tit-for-tat escalation came hours after President Donald Trump’s 104% tariffs on Chinese imports went into effect, including 50% Trump added Monday. Later Wednesday, Trump increased the overall U.S. tariff on Chinese goods to 125%, even as he paused higher targeted tariffs on other countries for 90 days while keeping a 10% baseline tariff in place for all countries. Trump’s 50% tariff is a “mistake upon another mistake,” China’s Customs Tariff Commission said in a statement earlier Wednesday, adding that the world’s two biggest economies should “resolve differences through equal dialogue based on mutual respect.”  The effect of China’s 84% tariff may be somewhat limited because China imports only about $160 billion a year in U.S. goods compared with the more than $400 billion in goods it exports to the U.S. “I don’t think they can match in the economic realm, because the relationship is so unbalanced,” said Rick Waters, the Singapore-based director of the Carnegie China think tank. “So what they tend to do is move into adjacent realms to exact a price.”  Here's a look at some of the other measures China might take.  China could greatly increase tariffs on U.S. agricultural products, or even stop importing them completely. “I think there’s a very high chance that China will stop agricultural imports from the U.S. altogether,” said Tianchen Xu, a Beijing-based economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit, a financial forecasting service. “It’s a weapon targeting Trump’s supporter base,” he added.  Soybeans, which are crushed to make protein-rich animal feed ingredients and vegetable oils, have been at the heart of the U.S.-China trade dispute for some time. U.S. exports of soybeans to China fell 75% after China imposed a retaliatory 25% tariff on them in 2018, during Trump’s first-term trade war with Beijing. The Trump administration announced $12 billion in subsidies for farmers to offset the impact, and it has again promised to step in if the latest round of tariffs hurts the industry further. China could also put further restrictions on American poultry products, having announced an import ban on two U.S. companies last week. China, which frequently trades places with North America as the world’s largest box office, is a crucial market for Hollywood films. Though China has an annual quota for the number of foreign movies that can appear in its theaters, it could ban Hollywood films altogether. American movies have already been declining in popularity in recent years as U.S.-China trade tensions have escalated. There were no Hollywood films among China’s 10 highest-grossing movies in 2023, in stark contrast to 2012, when seven of the top 10 highest-grossing movies were U.S.-made, according to Maoyan, a Chinese movie-ticketing and data platform.  The U.S. has a large trade deficit with China in goods, but it comes out ahead when it comes to services such as finance, consulting and law. U.S. data lists China as its fifth-largest export market for services, according to a report by China’s State Council released Wednesday. China could target the U.S. services sector, for example, by excluding American companies from government procurement processes or restricting their cooperation with Chinese firms. The U.S. has long accused China of stealing its intellectual property. But Beijing also has its own growing intellectual property interests, and it could investigate U.S. companies in China in an effort to protect them. China and the U.S. have made progress on stemming the international flow of precursor ingredients for fentanyl, some of which originate in China and are then processed into the deadly opioid in countries such as Mexico before being smuggled into the U.S.  But China could bring that cooperation to a halt in response to Trump’s tariffs. “Out of humanitarian considerations, China has provided various forms of assistance to the U.S.,” Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said last month. “The U.S. should not repay goodwill with hostility.” Waters said it would be “counterproductive” for China to suspend cooperation on fentanyl. “It’s just going to cement narratives in the U.S. that they’re weaponizing drugs against us,” he said.

115,"Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton’s attempt to topple Republican Sen. John Cornyn in a Senate primary next year kicks off one of the most intense contests of the 2026 elections — a GOP-versus-GOP battle between two men who have been sparring for years and vying for President Donald Trump’s attention.

Cornyn is a fixture of the Republican Party in Texas, serving in its highest offices for more than 30 years and becoming a key voice on Capitol Hill. Paxton, the third-term attorney general who survived a bipartisan impeachment last year in part thanks to support from Trump and conservative activist allies, believes there’s an opening to cut the incumbent down from the right.

Now, both sides are aligning themselves with Trump amid the possibility of an endorsement that could tip the primary.

Whether one comes or not, one thing is clear. “This is gonna be the nastiest race in the modern era of Texas politics, period,” former Travis County GOP chairman Matt Mackowiak said.

Paxton immediately attacked Cornyn for having “turned his back on President Trump,” pointing to comments Cornyn made in 2023 about Trump’s indictment over his handling of classified documents, as well as the senator’s comments that he didn’t think Trump “could win the presidency” after Trump was found liable for sexual abuse in a civil case that same year.

Paxton has also targeted Cornyn over his votes on issues including guns and immigration to try to argue that he is more aligned with conservative values.

“While John was criticizing Trump and suggesting he shouldn’t run, I was at Mar-a-Lago” for Trump’s presidential announcement speech, Paxton told “The Mark Davis Show” in Dallas.

""If he had the record of [Texas GOP Sen.] Ted Cruz, would I be here? Absolutely not,"" Paxton continued. ""This isn’t about what he’s saying and the love he suddenly has for President Trump and the love he has for all of our issues now. This isn’t about that love. I don’t believe that love, I believe in action.""

Cornyn, though, also made an appeal to Trump’s interests, telling reporters at the Capitol on Wednesday that Paxton’s Senate bid is a “con man’s vanity project.”

“The biggest potential loser is President Trump’s agenda,” Cornyn said of the primary challenge.

“Mr. Paxton has a checkered background, he is a con man and a fraud, and I think the people of Texas know that, but this is what will be litigated during the course of this campaign. I am not going to turn over the Senate seat that was once held by Sam Houston to someone like him,” he added, a reference to the 2023 impeachment trial of Paxton, after which he survived a conviction vote in the state Senate.

“It’s unclear to me exactly what is motivating Mr. Paxton other than vanity and personal ambition,” Cornyn continued.

In the months before Paxton jumped in — and in the hours since — Cornyn has made clear he’s hugging Trump as tight as he can. He posted on X a photo of him reading Trump’s “The Art of the Deal” and called it “recommended” reading; he took to the Senate floor to defend Trump aide and billionaire Elon Musk (whose businesses have a significant footprint in Texas) after protests at Tesla dealerships; and he has been framing himself as one of Trump’s top allies in the Senate.

A long-simmering feud

The roots of this clash between another establishment-insurgent pair of Republicans run deep, part of a decade-plus battle within the Texas GOP that has ousted legislative leaders, fueled Cruz's rise, fanned the flames of Paxton’s impeachment, and led to proxy wars up and down the ballot.

Paxton had been telegraphing a run against Cornyn from the right for more than a year. In early 2024, Paxton lambasted the senator as “anti-Trump [and] anti-gun” in a post on X, adding that “Texans deserve another conservative Senator.”

Cornyn reposted the message and replied: “Hard to run from prison, Ken,” a reference to the investigations that led to the impeachment trial. (The Associated Press reported this month that the Justice Department decided last year not to prosecute Paxton over corruption allegations.)

Brendan Steinhauser, a longtime GOP consultant who served as Cornyn’s campaign manager in the past but is unaffiliated in this race, told NBC News it’s no surprise to see Cornyn campaign with an eye on Trump.

“If you’re Senator Cornyn, you’re going to be campaigning on all the ways that you have supported and worked with the president, you’re going to talk about all the policies where you align, you’re going to talk about helping to get all of his judicial nominees through,” he said.

While a potential endorsement from Trump remains a major question, Cornyn does have support from Senate Republicans. Sen. Tim Scott, of South Carolina, who chairs the National Republican Senatorial Committee, has made his case for Cornyn to White House officials.

Scott also told Rep. Wesley Hunt, R-Texas, who has also been weighing a Senate run, that the NRSC is behind Cornyn, according to a source familiar with the discussions.

“John Cornyn is a leader who delivers on President Trump’s agenda and for the people of Texas in the U.S. Senate,” Scott said in a statement to NBC News. “He’s a proven fighter, man of faith and essential part of the Republican Senate Majority.”

Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., has also been publicly backing Cornyn and recently told CNN he was hopeful Trump would back Cornyn in the race.

Asked Wednesday if he has personally asked Trump to endorse Cornyn, Thune told reporters at the Capitol: “Well, we’re having conversations about all of the races on the map. When we have anything to report, we’ll let you know.”

Senate Leadership Fund, the main GOP super PAC involved in Senate races, which is aligned with Republican leadership, indicated it is also in Cornyn's corner.

""Leader John Thune, NRSC Chairman Tim Scott, and many of their colleagues have expressed great admiration and support for Senator John Cornyn and his years of service to the people of Texas,"" SLF Chairman Cory Gardner, a former senator from Colorado, said in a statement to NBC News. ""The Senate Leadership Fund fully intends on seeing him reelected next November.""

Mackowiak, a longtime Texas political consultant, told NBC News that he sees Paxton’s early announcement as an indication of two things: The attorney general sees an opening, but he knows he needs time to raise the money required to combat Cornyn and the power of incumbency.

“Paxton’s never run a race this complicated, this expensive against someone as accomplished and serious as John Cornyn,"" he said. ""John Cornyn has never been challenged by someone that has the statewide profile and grassroots enthusiasm Paxton has.""

But Mackowiak argued that while Paxton has sought to go on offense early, that dynamic may not stick, and that the events that led to Paxton’s impeachment trial (which divided Republicans in the state) will likely be relitigated.

“He is going to be playing a lot more defense than he even understands. I think because he got through impeachment, these issues are behind him. They’re not,” he said.

One potential wrinkle, particularly if Hunt or another Republican decides to jump in, is Texas’ runoff rules. If no candidate wins the majority of the vote in the primary, the top two move on to a one-on-one runoff election.

Cornyn has never lost an election in Texas, and he’s never been forced to a runoff by any of his opponents (who have largely challenged him from the right). But the prospect of a split field leading to a runoff is another complicating factor, with both Mackowiak and Steinhauser noting that runoff electorates typically favor the candidate with more grassroots conservative support.

Senate map

The Texas race could have broader implications for the fight for the Senate next year as Republicans look to defend their slim majority.

Democrats need to net three seats to take control of the Senate, but they face an uphill battle with a short list of targets. Just one Republican — Maine’s Susan Collins — is running in a state that former Vice President Kamala Harris carried in November. Republicans, meanwhile, are looking to grow their majority by targeting Democratic-held seats in battleground states.

But Cornyn said a competitive election in Texas could put a strain on Republicans nationally by diverting money away from other key battlegrounds.

“We’re going to end up spending hundreds of millions of dollars, potentially, on this race in Texas, because we can’t lose the seat in Texas,” said Cornyn, a former NRSC chairman. “And that is money that can’t be used in places like Michigan, New Hampshire and Georgia in the midterm elections.”

Democrats have long coveted the idea of flipping Texas, with former Rep. Beto O’Rourke coming close to defeating Cruz in the blue wave year of 2018. But Trump expanded his margin last year in Texas compared to 2020, carrying Texas by 14 percentage points as Cruz defeated former Democratic Rep. Colin Allred by 9 points.

Allred told The Dallas Morning News last month that he is “seriously considering” another run for Senate against Cornyn. Cruz, meanwhile, told reporters Wednesday that he is staying neutral in this year’s Senate primary, saying both Paxton and Cornyn are friends.

“I have worked closely with both of them. I respect them both,” Cruz said. “And I trust the voters of Texas to make that decision.”

A divisive GOP primary could play into Democrats’ hands — especially if Paxton is the nominee. In the meantime, Democrats are watching the GOP primary process play out in Texas and other states. Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee spokesperson Maeve Coyle noted that former New Hampshire GOP Gov. Chris Sununu announced Tuesday that he would not be running for that state’s open Senate seat.

“As Republicans face a nasty primary in Texas and an embarrassing recruitment failure in New Hampshire — coupled with a building midterm backlash across the map driven by their threats to Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and their push to spike costs for families — Democrats will look for every opportunity to put them on defense,” Coyle said."
630,"Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News  news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time WASHINGTON — As President Donald Trump ramps up attacks on the judiciary, the Republican-led House voted Wednesday to limit district court judges’ ability to issue the nationwide injunctions that have hampered some of his executive actions.  The vote was 219-213, with just one Republican, Mike Turner of Ohio, joining all Democrats in opposing it. The bill now heads to the Senate, where it would almost certainly be blocked by a Democratic filibuster if it were brought to the floor. Trump and many of his allies on the far right had been pushing House Republicans to take a more extreme step and attempt to impeach judges that stood in his way. The ""No Rogue Rulings Act,"" authored by Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., doesn’t go that far, but it allows House Republicans to voice their support for Trump on the issue while avoiding politically perilous impeachment votes that would be all but doomed to fail. Follow live politics coverage here In a brief interview, Issa argued that both parties would benefit from the legislation. He said that during President Joe Biden's administration, Democrats howled when conservative judges issued nationwide injunctions against his executive actions.  ""This is a growing problem that has vexed both Republican and Democrat presidents,"" Issa, a senior member of the Judiciary Committee and the former chairman of the Oversight Committee, said before the vote. Biden, ""to the very end, was trying to get this process of activist judges exceeding their jurisdiction rolled back."" This bill, Issa said, ""limits judges to the original intent, which will allow them to make decisions but only as to the plaintiffs."" Trump and his allies have grown frustrated with lower-court judges’ issuing injunctions blocking Trump’s actions on deportations of undocumented immigrants, sweeping cuts and mass firings at federal agencies, ending birthright citizenship and other matters. Much of Republicans' criticism has centered on U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, who halted Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants alleged to be Tren de Aragua gang members.  After that decision, Rep. Brandon Gill, R-Texas, a Trump ally, introduced a resolution to impeach Boasberg, who is based in Washington, D.C. Other judges who have ruled against Trump also have faced impeachment threats, including U.S. District Judges Paul A. Engelmayer and John Bates. But GOP leaders have acknowledged such impeachment resolutions wouldn't have enough support to pass out of the House, where Republicans hold a narrow 220-213 majority.  On top of that, 67 votes would be needed for convictions in the Senate, where Republicans have a 53-47 majority. In some high-profile cases, the conservative-leaning Supreme Court has been ruling in Trump’s favor. On Monday, it tossed out Boasberg’s decision blocking the removal of the alleged gang members to El Salvador. A day later, the Supreme Court halted a ruling by U.S. District Judge William Alsup of California requiring some federal agencies to reinstate roughly 16,000 workers the Trump administration had tried to fire. Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, said his party in the past has tried to block ""judicial forum shopping,"" in which plaintiffs try to pick courts where they have higher chances of winning. ""But a nationwide injunction is a necessary part of the judicial tool kit,"" said Raskin, a former constitutional law professor. ""Why should every person affected [by an issue] have to go to court? Why should millions of people have to create their own case?""  ""Why should Brown vs. Board of Education have applied to just Linda Brown as opposed to everybody affected?"" he added.

114,"President Donald Trump and his billionaire adviser Elon Musk have fanned the flames of a baseless rumor about America’s gold reserves at least a dozen times since mid-February.

The conspiracy theory, alleging without evidence that someone might have stolen the gold reserves from Fort Knox, Kentucky, has circulated for decades, but it seems to have first appeared on the Trump administration’s radar after far-right financial blog Zero Hedge tagged Musk in a post about the idea on X.

Since then, Musk and Trump have shared the idea and teased plans for a personal inspection of the fortress that holds the government’s gold bars.

Despite raising alarm and fueling conspiracy chatter online and offline, there is no evidence that any gold is missing, and there’s no indication that Musk or Trump has taken any concrete steps toward visiting Fort Knox. A White House spokesperson declined to comment on their plans, saying in an email: “No announcements at this time.”

The rumor immediately found an audience, including gold obsessives who have nurtured conspiracy theories about government gold reserves for more than 50 years. Many of them stubbornly reject the evidence that Fort Knox is secure, and they interpret its security measures as evidence that the government is hiding something.

Aaron Klein, the chair of economic studies at the Brookings Institution, said the statements by Musk and Trump fit a pattern of the two men trying to sow doubt in traditional institutions.

“The gold has come to have a symbolic value of the faith in the U.S. government’s fundamental position,” said Klein, who served in the Obama Treasury Department.

“Questioning the gold as having been ‘lost’ or ‘stolen’ is part of a series of actions that undermine confidence in America,” he added. “Why somebody who purports to be trying to restore America would want to undermine its confidence is confusing.”

Trump and Musk are tapping into a classic but obscure rumor with a long history: People have recycled the claim that Fort Knox is empty on a semiregular basis, sometimes paired with vague anti-government vibes.

“It comes up periodically, and it has for decades,” said Philip Diehl, a former director of the U.S. Mint, which oversees the gold storage. “Eventually, the pressure builds, and the president sends somebody in to take a look.”

In 1974, after a gadfly author named Peter Beter charged that unnamed powerful interests had looted Fort Knox, the rumor spread so widely that the U.S. Mint decided to invite lawmakers and journalists for a tour. And in 2011, then-Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, who favored abolishing the Federal Reserve and returning to a gold-based currency system, held a congressional hearing on whether the Fort Knox gold was secure. Treasury officials from both Republican and Democratic administrations have repeatedly said the gold is fine, and in 2017, Trump’s treasury secretary at the time, Steven Mnuchin, visited the Kentucky fortress and came away satisfied.

“The gold was there when I visited it. I hope nobody’s moved it. I’m sure they haven’t,” Mnuchin, who isn’t serving in Trump’s second administration, told CNBC in February.

Trump’s current treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, told podcast host Dan O’Donnell in February: “All the gold is present and accounted for.”

No visit has materialized in the nearly two months since then, and it’s not clear why.

Paul, the former congressman, said he’s not sure Musk and Trump will follow through. He has criticized Trump at times, including for bombing Yemen last month.

“They have other things to deal with. They have to plan the bombing in Yemen, and they have to deal with the oil in Syria. They have to stop a war on Ukraine, and so the gold they can forget about for a while. They’ll avoid it if they see an advantage to it. So that is why people don’t trust governments,” he said.

Paul said he believes past audits haven’t been thorough enough. He wants Trump and Musk to perform lab tests known as assays to determine the exact composition of the gold bars.

The gold reserve used to have a practical purpose: to allow foreign governments to swap their dollars for gold. But President Richard Nixon ended the practice in 1971. Now, its value is mainly symbolic of U.S. wealth, and other countries, such as China, have recently sought to build up their own reserves.

The gold theft rumors have come in several varieties, all without evidence, among them that European bankers took the gold or that the Rockefeller banking family did.

Certain conspiracy theories tend to pop up repeatedly over time, said Bret Schafer, a senior fellow who studies disinformation at the German Marshall Fund, a nonprofit organization that works to strengthen the U.S.-Europe alliance. Allegedly government-made bioweapons are one such recurring conspiracy theory, he said, and the Fort Knox gold rumor is another.

“These rumors work best when they’re built up over time. It’s like Hollywood sequels: You build off the original,” he said. And in both cases, he added, “you just get a lot of retreads.”

Fort Knox has appeared in movies that add to its allure. A scheme involving the facility is a major plot point in the 1964 James Bond film “Goldfinger,” underscoring the belief that Fort Knox could be a tempting target.

And unlike some internet-era hoaxes, the Fort Knox rumors originated in an age when conspiracy theories spread by less efficient means, not on X, whose owner, Musk, has 218 million listed followers.

“It precedes the social media digital age, but now we’re in an environment where things can pop from the corners of ‘conspiracy land’ to policy action in a matter of hours, because all of you have to do is land on Musk’s radar,” Schafer said.

Formally known as the U.S. Bullion Depository, the gold reserve site is next to the Army base Fort Knox. It was built in 1936, and President Franklin Roosevelt was the only visitor until the tour for media and members of Congress in 1974.

The tour 51 years ago yielded newspaper headlines such as one in The New York Times: “Visitors Get a Peek at Fort Knox Gold—It’s There.”

The Treasury Department’s nonpartisan inspector general audits the gold every year, said Eric Thorson, a former inspector general who’s now retired. He said that he sent teams of about three people every year and that he went personally once in 2011.

“There is absolutely zero doubt the gold is there,” he said.

“I’m a former Air Force pilot. I’ve been on bases with nuclear weapons, and this place has every bit the security that any nuclear base has,” he added. “The security is unbelievable. Nobody’s going to go in there and take it.”

Zero Hedge, a far-right financial blog and social media brand that appears to have first alerted Musk to the idea, frequently posts about gold as an investment. It tweeted in 2011 about Paul’s Fort Knox concerns and in 2017 about Mnuchin’s Fort Knox visit. Sometimes, accounts on X respond to Zero Hedge posts with commentary about Fort Knox.

Then, on Feb. 15, Zero Hedge posted a suggestion on X and tagged Musk directly.

“It would be great if @elonmusk could take a look inside Fort Knox just to make sure the 4,580 tons of US gold is there. Last time anyone looked was 50 years ago in 1974,” the account posted.

The second sentence is wrong, according to Thorson, but the post got the attention of Musk and others. It had 3.3 million views as of Friday.

“Surely it’s reviewed at least every year?” Musk responded to the post. Zero Hedge replied, repeating the falsehood that the gold isn’t reviewed every year.

Google Trends data shows that after the interaction, web searches for the term “Fort Knox” hit their highest level since Google began collecting data in 2004 and kept rising for several days.

On Feb. 16, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., Ron Paul’s son, chimed in. He repeated the inaccuracy that the gold isn’t reviewed annually and said, “Let’s do it.”

Zero Hedge has often faced restrictions on tech platforms for violating terms of service, including publishing allegedly derogatory material. In 2022, U.S. intelligence officials accused the site of amplifying Russian propaganda, a claim it denied. But under Musk’s ownership of X, Zero Hedge has thrived, growing its follower count from 1.5 million to 2.1 million.

Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones also discussed the Fort Knox rumor on his podcast. He said he supported Musk’s looking into Fort Knox while acknowledging that he heard the same rumor as a child more than 40 years ago. Jones’ sponsors and advertisers have for years included gold retailers.

Soon, Musk and Trump were fueling the uncertainty. On Feb. 17, Musk posted on X about the gold: “Maybe it’s there, maybe it’s not.” He spoke about it on Joe Rogan’s podcast and at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference, often mixing the conspiracy theory with attempts at humor.

“We want to go see it and just make sure somebody didn’t spray-paint some lead or something, you know?” Musk said at CPAC on Feb. 20.

Musk reiterated his intention to inspect the goal as recently as March 30 at a town hall-style event in Wisconsin, after an unidentified audience member raised the subject. “You were going to go check our gold, and I’m worried about the Democrats and Joe Biden’s last administration with the money not being there,” the audience member said.

“Did you get blocked? Or are you still able to check that?” he asked.

“That’s up to the president, of course, but I think it would be awesome to livestream Fort Knox,” Musk responded. “Hopefully it looks really cool.”

Trump mentioned it to reporters several times, including in the Oval Office on Feb. 24. He has a longtime fascination with gold, with a golden escalator at one of his New York towers and a chocolate bar wrapped in gold foil for sale on his website for $86.

“We’re actually going to Fort Knox to see if the gold is there, because maybe somebody stole the gold, tons of gold,” Trump said, without citing any evidence.

The gold facility doesn’t offer tours, and its website is blunt: “No visitors are permitted in the facility.” But the Treasury Department answers to the president and would presumably let him in. The department didn’t respond to requests for comment.

The U.S. Mint says Fort Knox holds about 147.3 million ounces of gold currently, or about half the Treasury’s total gold reserves. That’s worth about $450 billion at the current market price — which is both a massive fortune and not enough to cover what the federal government spends in a single month.

Diehl, who was director of the U.S. Mint in the 1990s, said there’s a lot of overlap between Trump’s voting base and people who invest in metals such as gold or commemorative coins.

“Talking about gold speaks directly to his base,” said Diehl, who’s now the president of U.S. Money Reserve, a gold retailer.

Diehl said he’s certain the Fort Knox gold is secure, and yet he said he anticipates a surprise announcement of some kind by Trump, just given his approaching to governing: maybe selling the gold, maybe buying more, maybe something else entirely.

The price of gold soared to record highs in recent days amid concerns about Trump’s trade wars before they fell again along with other asset prices since last week’s tariff announcement. It’s unclear whether Musk or Trump has any personal gold holdings.

Thorson, the retired Treasury Department inspector general, said he believes the Fort Knox rumors are politically useful for Trump and Musk.

“What is probably happening here is taking any chance to make the American public feel that they’re being taken advantage of and that they’re a victim,” he said. Now, he said, Trump and Musk can position themselves as saviors in the mold of Trump’s 2016 statement “I alone can fix it.”

And the longer the visit doesn’t happen, the more useful the rumors become for anyone who benefits from them.

“If the intent is to undermine the financial system, you don’t actually want anyone to go there and look,” said Schafer, of the German Marshall Fund."
44,"President Donald Trump and his billionaire adviser Elon Musk have fanned the flames of a baseless rumor about America’s gold reserves at least a dozen times since mid-February.

The conspiracy theory, alleging without evidence that someone might have stolen the gold reserves from Fort Knox, Kentucky, has circulated for decades, but it seems to have first appeared on the Trump administration’s radar after far-right financial blog Zero Hedge tagged Musk in a post about the idea on X.

Since then, Musk and Trump have shared the idea and teased plans for a personal inspection of the fortress that holds the government’s gold bars.

Despite raising alarm and fueling conspiracy chatter online and offline, there is no evidence that any gold is missing, and there’s no indication that Musk or Trump has taken any concrete steps toward visiting Fort Knox. A White House spokesperson declined to comment on their plans, saying in an email: “No announcements at this time.”

The rumor immediately found an audience, including gold obsessives who have nurtured conspiracy theories about government gold reserves for more than 50 years. Many of them stubbornly reject the evidence that Fort Knox is secure, and they interpret its security measures as evidence that the government is hiding something.

Aaron Klein, the chair of economic studies at the Brookings Institution, said the statements by Musk and Trump fit a pattern of the two men trying to sow doubt in traditional institutions.

“The gold has come to have a symbolic value of the faith in the U.S. government’s fundamental position,” said Klein, who served in the Obama Treasury Department.

“Questioning the gold as having been ‘lost’ or ‘stolen’ is part of a series of actions that undermine confidence in America,” he added. “Why somebody who purports to be trying to restore America would want to undermine its confidence is confusing.”

Trump and Musk are tapping into a classic but obscure rumor with a long history: People have recycled the claim that Fort Knox is empty on a semiregular basis, sometimes paired with vague anti-government vibes.

“It comes up periodically, and it has for decades,” said Philip Diehl, a former director of the U.S. Mint, which oversees the gold storage. “Eventually, the pressure builds, and the president sends somebody in to take a look.”

In 1974, after a gadfly author named Peter Beter charged that unnamed powerful interests had looted Fort Knox, the rumor spread so widely that the U.S. Mint decided to invite lawmakers and journalists for a tour. And in 2011, then-Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, who favored abolishing the Federal Reserve and returning to a gold-based currency system, held a congressional hearing on whether the Fort Knox gold was secure. Treasury officials from both Republican and Democratic administrations have repeatedly said the gold is fine, and in 2017, Trump’s treasury secretary at the time, Steven Mnuchin, visited the Kentucky fortress and came away satisfied.

“The gold was there when I visited it. I hope nobody’s moved it. I’m sure they haven’t,” Mnuchin, who isn’t serving in Trump’s second administration, told CNBC in February.

Trump’s current treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, told podcast host Dan O’Donnell in February: “All the gold is present and accounted for.”

No visit has materialized in the nearly two months since then, and it’s not clear why.

Paul, the former congressman, said he’s not sure Musk and Trump will follow through. He has criticized Trump at times, including for bombing Yemen last month.

“They have other things to deal with. They have to plan the bombing in Yemen, and they have to deal with the oil in Syria. They have to stop a war on Ukraine, and so the gold they can forget about for a while. They’ll avoid it if they see an advantage to it. So that is why people don’t trust governments,” he said.

Paul said he believes past audits haven’t been thorough enough. He wants Trump and Musk to perform lab tests known as assays to determine the exact composition of the gold bars.

The gold reserve used to have a practical purpose: to allow foreign governments to swap their dollars for gold. But President Richard Nixon ended the practice in 1971. Now, its value is mainly symbolic of U.S. wealth, and other countries, such as China, have recently sought to build up their own reserves.

The gold theft rumors have come in several varieties, all without evidence, among them that European bankers took the gold or that the Rockefeller banking family did.

Certain conspiracy theories tend to pop up repeatedly over time, said Bret Schafer, a senior fellow who studies disinformation at the German Marshall Fund, a nonprofit organization that works to strengthen the U.S.-Europe alliance. Allegedly government-made bioweapons are one such recurring conspiracy theory, he said, and the Fort Knox gold rumor is another.

“These rumors work best when they’re built up over time. It’s like Hollywood sequels: You build off the original,” he said. And in both cases, he added, “you just get a lot of retreads.”

Fort Knox has appeared in movies that add to its allure. A scheme involving the facility is a major plot point in the 1964 James Bond film “Goldfinger,” underscoring the belief that Fort Knox could be a tempting target.

And unlike some internet-era hoaxes, the Fort Knox rumors originated in an age when conspiracy theories spread by less efficient means, not on X, whose owner, Musk, has 218 million listed followers.

“It precedes the social media digital age, but now we’re in an environment where things can pop from the corners of ‘conspiracy land’ to policy action in a matter of hours, because all of you have to do is land on Musk’s radar,” Schafer said.

Formally known as the U.S. Bullion Depository, the gold reserve site is next to the Army base Fort Knox. It was built in 1936, and President Franklin Roosevelt was the only visitor until the tour for media and members of Congress in 1974.

The tour 51 years ago yielded newspaper headlines such as one in The New York Times: “Visitors Get a Peek at Fort Knox Gold—It’s There.”

The Treasury Department’s nonpartisan inspector general audits the gold every year, said Eric Thorson, a former inspector general who’s now retired. He said that he sent teams of about three people every year and that he went personally once in 2011.

“There is absolutely zero doubt the gold is there,” he said.

“I’m a former Air Force pilot. I’ve been on bases with nuclear weapons, and this place has every bit the security that any nuclear base has,” he added. “The security is unbelievable. Nobody’s going to go in there and take it.”

Zero Hedge, a far-right financial blog and social media brand that appears to have first alerted Musk to the idea, frequently posts about gold as an investment. It tweeted in 2011 about Paul’s Fort Knox concerns and in 2017 about Mnuchin’s Fort Knox visit. Sometimes, accounts on X respond to Zero Hedge posts with commentary about Fort Knox.

7,"WASHINGTON — As President Donald Trump ramps up attacks on the judiciary, the Republican-led House voted Wednesday to limit district court judges’ ability to issue the nationwide injunctions that have hampered some of his executive actions.

The vote was 219-213, with just one Republican, Mike Turner of Ohio, joining all Democrats in opposing it. The bill now heads to the Senate, where it would almost certainly be blocked by a Democratic filibuster if it were brought to the floor.

Trump and many of his allies on the far right had been pushing House Republicans to take a more extreme step and attempt to impeach judges that stood in his way.

The ""No Rogue Rulings Act,"" authored by Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., doesn’t go that far, but it allows House Republicans to voice their support for Trump on the issue while avoiding politically perilous impeachment votes that would be all but doomed to fail.

Follow live politics coverage here

In a brief interview, Issa argued that both parties would benefit from the legislation. He said that during President Joe Biden's administration, Democrats howled when conservative judges issued nationwide injunctions against his executive actions.

""This is a growing problem that has vexed both Republican and Democrat presidents,"" Issa, a senior member of the Judiciary Committee and the former chairman of the Oversight Committee, said before the vote. Biden, ""to the very end, was trying to get this process of activist judges exceeding their jurisdiction rolled back.""

This bill, Issa said, ""limits judges to the original intent, which will allow them to make decisions but only as to the plaintiffs.""

Trump and his allies have grown frustrated with lower-court judges’ issuing injunctions blocking Trump’s actions on deportations of undocumented immigrants, sweeping cuts and mass firings at federal agencies, ending birthright citizenship and other matters.

Much of Republicans' criticism has centered on U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, who halted Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants alleged to be Tren de Aragua gang members.

After that decision, Rep. Brandon Gill, R-Texas, a Trump ally, introduced a resolution to impeach Boasberg, who is based in Washington, D.C. Other judges who have ruled against Trump also have faced impeachment threats, including U.S. District Judges Paul A. Engelmayer and John Bates.

But GOP leaders have acknowledged such impeachment resolutions wouldn't have enough support to pass out of the House, where Republicans hold a narrow 220-213 majority.

On top of that, 67 votes would be needed for convictions in the Senate, where Republicans have a 53-47 majority.

In some high-profile cases, the conservative-leaning Supreme Court has been ruling in Trump’s favor. On Monday, it tossed out Boasberg’s decision blocking the removal of the alleged gang members to El Salvador.

A day later, the Supreme Court halted a ruling by U.S. District Judge William Alsup of California requiring some federal agencies to reinstate roughly 16,000 workers the Trump administration had tried to fire.

Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, said his party in the past has tried to block ""judicial forum shopping,"" in which plaintiffs try to pick courts where they have higher chances of winning.

""But a nationwide injunction is a necessary part of the judicial tool kit,"" said Raskin, a former constitutional law professor. ""Why should every person affected [by an issue] have to go to court? Why should millions of people have to create their own case?""

""Why should Brown vs. Board of Education have applied to just Linda Brown as opposed to everybody affected?"" he added."
631,"Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News  news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Gretchen Whitmer became governor after promising to “fix the damn roads” in Michigan.  Whether she goes any further depends on how well she can navigate some of the early bumps surfacing as she positions herself for a possible White House bid. On Wednesday, during a trip to Washington, D.C., that put a spotlight on her prospects in 2028, Whitmer hit what many of her fellow Democrats saw as two sizable potholes. First, in a policy speech outlining a “consistent national strategy,” Whitmer staked out common ground with President Donald Trump. And though Whitmer criticized Trump’s sweeping, roller-coaster rollout of — and subsequent retreat from — tariffs, she said she was not against tariffs “outright” and expressed understanding of Trump’s “motivation” behind deploying them. That drew a social media rebuke from Colorado’s Democratic governor, Jared Polis. “Tariffs are bad outright because they lead to higher prices and destroy American manufacturing,” Polis, another potential 2028 contender who has also sought ways to find common cause with Trump, wrote on X. “Trade is inherently good because both parties emerge better off from a consensual transaction.” Then, later Wednesday, Whitmer joined Trump in the Oval Office. She was scheduled to meet privately with him and discuss Michigan issues. That wasn’t how it ultimately played out.  Instead, she stood by as he signed several executive orders, including two calling for Justice Department probes of officials who served in his first administration and called him out for falsely claiming the 2020 election was stolen. He made the false claims about the election’s being “rigged” again Wednesday. Whitmer was invited into the Oval Office alongside Michigan state House Speaker Matt Hall, a Republican, as Trump held court with reporters and signed the executive orders. Photos showed Whitmer standing uncomfortably against a door as the cameras rolled. “She’s really done an excellent job,” Trump said of Whitmer during the impromptu media availability. “Very good person.” Though Trump did engage with her on issues she came to discuss, the fact that she was present at what amounted to a bipartisan photo opportunity as he took actions targeting political critics angered and confused allies. “Just a f---ing disaster,” said a Democratic operative who admires Whitmer and, like others interviewed for this article, was granted anonymity to share candid thoughts about her day. “It feels like it removes some of the momentum she had as a politically savvy swing-state Dem.” Whitmer’s team moved quickly to contain the fallout and counter mounting criticism from within her party. “The governor was surprised that she was brought into the Oval Office during President Trump’s press conference without any notice of the subject matter,” a Whitmer spokesperson said in a statement. “Her presence is not an endorsement of the actions taken or statements made at that event.” Democrats have long seen Whitmer as one of the party’s more formidable figures — a two-term governor of a battleground state who won re-election in a landslide and was nearly tapped to be Joe Biden’s running mate in 2020 after having considerably raised her public profile during the Covid pandemic. Whitmer is among a handful of prominent Democratic governors viewed as potential presidential contenders in 2028. But unlike some of her contemporaries, Whitmer has chosen to seek out a stronger working relationship with Trump in his second term. Trump won her state last fall, and Whitmer views herself as more of a center-left moderate with a middle-of-the-road, Midwestern constituency — one that is receptive to Trump’s message, including and especially on manufacturing and tariff policy.  In her Washington speech Wednesday, Whitmer called for cutting red tape and building more in the United States. She also railed against “partisanship,” saying it has seemingly “infected every aspect of our lives, and it’s exhausting.” “Let’s give more hard-working people a fair shot at a decent life,” she said. “And let’s usher in, as President Trump says, a ‘Golden Age’ of American manufacturing.” She did break with Trump on the more substantial tariffs he announced last week and partially paused later Wednesday afternoon, describing them as a “triple whammy: higher costs, fewer jobs and more uncertainty.” “I understand the motivation behind the tariffs, and I can tell you here’s where President Trump and I do agree,” she said. “We do need to make more stuff in America — more cars and chips, more steel and ships. We do need fair trade.” Her stance on tariffs puts her at odds with other potential Democratic presidential hopefuls, like Polis and Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, who offered sharp criticism of Trump’s “wrongheaded” measures in a speech in his state Wednesday. During a question-and-answer session with journalist Gretchen Carlson after her speech, Whitmer empathized with the many Democrats who don’t want Democratic officials to work with Trump. But she said she needs to be collaborative because “I took an oath to the people of Michigan to try to get as much done for the state.” Whitmer also said she hadn’t “thought through” how she’d handle tariffs differently from Trump, only that they should be used as a “scalpel.” A national Democratic strategist said, “It is a massive indictment on Whitmer and her team’s judgment to, first, not have an answer on the tariff question and then go the White House and get absolutely played by Donald Trump to the point she is caught in the Oval Office as he signs one of his revenge and retribution executive orders and says 2020 was rigged.”  About tariffs, her spokesperson emphasized areas of disagreement with Trump rather than ways the two overlap on the policy.  “This morning, the governor delivered a speech in Washington, D.C., about the devastating effects tariffs were having on Michiganders — from companies increasing prices and laying off workers to retirement accounts being wiped out,” Whitmer’s spokesperson said. “This afternoon, the 90-day pause was announced, and that is a step in the right direction and will provide relief to so many businesses across the state, but we remain concerned about tariffs that will hurt American auto companies.” Whitmer and Hall were supposed to discuss with Trump federal investment at Michigan’s Selfridge Air National Guard Base, a recent devastating ice storm in the state and a plan to deal with invasive Asian carp in Lake Michigan. Whitmer’s team and her allies described the meeting as a success on those matters. “Governor Whitmer thanks President Trump for his acknowledgements on protecting the Great Lakes from invasive carp, his work on Selfridge, and his openness to our request for help in northern Michigan,” her spokesperson said. A Democratic official who used to work with Whitmer said her dealings with Trump show she “is very good at advocating for her state.” “And President Trump clearly listens to what she says and what she does,” this person said. “You saw that today on tariffs, on the progress they made on Selfridge and on the other issues she brought to discuss.” Whitmer’s day also offered some political nuance. Her visit to the Oval Office didn’t annoy just Democrats. Republicans complained that it was an unnecessary boost to a leader they have long tried to demonize in a crucial electoral battleground. “Trump literally just f---ed Republicans in Michigan by saying Whitmer is doing an excellent job,” a Republican strategist from Michigan wrote in a text message. “I mean, WTF, she is running to replace him in 2028.” The budding Trump-Whitmer relationship — Wednesday’s meeting was their second in less than two months — would have been unthinkable not so long ago. Trump figured prominently in the political memoir Whitmer published last year, with a long-standing feud between them accounting for a large share of the first chapter: “Don’t Let the Bullies Get You Down.”  Whitmer wrote about how Trump responded to her criticism of his leadership during the early days of the pandemic by branding her dismissively and derisively as “that woman from Michigan.” Whitmer and her team embraced the insulting sobriquet, which became a staple in progressive merchandising. “That’s the secret to dealing with bullies: You take their weapon and make it your shield,” Whitmer wrote. “Every time Trump gave me a nickname, I made it my own.” That history had some observers struggling with cognitive dissonance Wednesday. “Whitmer hurt her candidacy today,” a Democratic strategist said. “She looked and sounded nervous in the Oval Office. That visual will stick. So will the image of Trump praising her as he signed executive orders targeting his critics.”  A second Democratic operative who has worked with Whitmer previously said her speech today felt like an “opening salvo” for a presidential bid. “There’s sort of this absolutism among Democrats where you’re either all against him or you’re not against him enough, right?” this person said. “And I think if you are a Midwestern governor, there are certainly appropriate times to be for tariffs.”  This person was surprised at the pushback she got from Polis after her address, adding that criticism showed “2028 is on.” But the person was also perplexed by Whitmer’s Oval Office appearance. “It overall seemed not great,” this person said. “The photo of her standing there in the corner looking uncomfortable. The odd banter. The whole thing didn’t make a lot of sense. Why did it happen? Whose idea was that?” Still, this person said Whitmer, who has pledged to work across the aisle, including with Trump, to deliver results for her state, can point to tangible results from her trip to Michiganders.  But nationally, the conversation around her visit will be very different. “Overall, hey, great visit, right?” this person continued, rattling off the local issues Whitmer went to discuss — before pivoting to the executive order spectacle. “It felt like, holy s---, what just happened?” Allan Smith is a political reporter for NBC News.

633,"Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News  news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time President Donald Trump said Wednesday he was pausing higher targeted tariffs for 90 days for most countries, a stunning reversal in his trade war that has sent markets reeling.   Trump wrote on social media just before 1:30 p.m. that he came to the decision because more than 75 trading partners didn’t retaliate and have reached out to the United States to “discuss” some of the issues he had raised.    The pause didn’t apply to China, which has retaliated — with 84% hikes. Trump instead raised duties for it to 125%, effective immediately.    “Based on the lack of respect that China has shown to the World’s Markets, I am hereby raising the Tariff charged to China by the United States of America to 125%, effective immediately,” he wrote. “At some point, hopefully in the near future, China will realize that the days of ripping off the U.S.A., and other Countries, is no longer sustainable or acceptable.”  But the trade war isn’t exactly over, and the pause didn’t return the world to the time before Trump touched off the global instability; a 10% across-the-board duty will remain. For Canada and Mexico, goods covered by the U.S., Canada and Mexico trade agreement will continue to have no tariffs, while products that aren't exempt under the trade deal will have a 25% tariff. Canadian energy and fertilizer products will have a 10% tariff. It wasn’t immediately clear which countries the pause would cover; the White House wouldn’t say. Earlier Wednesday, the European Union voted to impose fresh retaliatory duties, but they aren’t set to take effect until next week.   And separate tariffs on imported autos, steel and aluminum will remain, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said later — while planned tariffs on items like lumber and pharmaceuticals are still on.  It’s not clear what prompted Trump to change his mind — he appeared to dig in just hours earlier, telling Americans “BE COOL” in a Truth Social post, and he suggested not that long ago that the tariffs could be permanent.   “I did a 90-day pause for the people that didn’t retaliate, because I told them, ‘If you retaliate, we’re going to double it,’” Trump said Wednesday. “And that’s what I did with China, because they did retaliate. So we’ll see how it all works out. I think it’s going to work out amazing.”  But markets have been in stunning turmoil — major stock indexes shed trillions of dollars in value, while alarming signals from the bond market set Wall Street on edge.   When a false-at-the-time headline suggesting Trump would take a 90-day pause shot around the internet Monday, markets briefly surged. And a growing chorus of business leaders and Trump’s allies have come out publicly against the tariffs, including Tesla CEO Elon Musk.  Markets soared on the surprising news Wednesday, with the S&P 500 climbing more than 9%, the tech-heavy Nasdaq closing up more than 12% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average ending nearly 3,000 points higher. Among the big gainers: Tesla stock was up 22%. Despite the gains, all three indexes were down from where they were a month ago and at the start of the year, and some investors questioned what the recent volatility could mean for the U.S. stock market longer-term. ""My portfolio of defensive stocks is green so I don’t begrudge today’s market. But I ask you, would you want to own highly volatile US stocks whose price depends on whether POTUS had a good night’s sleep and woke up the next morning to reverse yesterday’s policies?"" billionaire investor Bill Gross said on X. Goldman Sachs lowered its odds of a recession but said it is still forecasting minimal economic growth and a 45% probability of a recession given the remaining tariffs. Borrowing costs — which had surged early Wednesday as the tariffs took effect — also eased slightly, though not substantially, as some investors may fear a lingering fallout.   Trump has been talking about tariffs as the solution for U.S. economic problems since before he became president; he branded April 2 — when he unveiled the plan — “Liberation Day,” saying it would end decades of the country’s being “looted, pillaged, raped and plundered” by other countries.  The global markets recoiled, and last week $6.6 trillion alone was wiped out. Yet Trump and his allies had doubled down until Wednesday, arguing tariffs were necessary to return manufacturing to the United States and fill the nation’s coffers with trillions of dollars in revenue that could be used to pay down debt or offset tax cuts.   It’s not clear how the White House expects the policies to fuel big gains now. With the lower 10% tariff rate left in place, there will be less incentive for companies to relocate production to the United States and less revenue being generated.  After the news, Bessent sought to make the about-face into a negotiating tactic, insisting it was a way to scare countries to come to the negotiating table by demonstrating how high the United States was going to go.    “President Trump created maximum negotiating leverage for himself,” he said.   It’s unclear how successful the United States will be at negotiating new trade agreements with other countries given Trump’s on-again, off-again threats over the past several months. Previously, he had threatened sweeping tariffs on all imports from Mexico and Canada before he walked most of them back.   And while markets surged higher Wednesday following Trump’s pause, economic uncertainty remains over what will come next in the U.S. trade war with China, which exports more than $400 billion worth of goods to the United States each year.   Under Trump’s new tariffs, the cost for U.S. companies importing goods from China has more than doubled. Those products include everything from toys and sneakers to televisions and iPhones.   U.S. companies exporting their products to China are also caught up in the fray after China increased its tariffs on American goods like agriculture products and machinery. But the White House is downplaying that risk.   “What I am certain of is that what China is doing will affect their economy much more than ours because they have an export-driven, flood-the-world-with-cheap-exports model,” Bessent said.  Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said on X that he sat with Trump as he posted the initial message, adding: “The world is ready to work with President Trump to fix global trade, and China has chosen the opposite direction.”  The Trump administration will now face the daunting task of trying to negotiate dozens of potentially complex and intricate trade deals in a three-month period.  ""That is a huge task to negotiate simultaneously with that many trading partners over that many issues,” said Greta Peisch, who was general counsel for the U.S. trade representative’s office during the Biden administration. “We have tariffs, non-tariff barriers, other non-trade related matters, all of those issues can get quite complicated quite quickly. Even with just a handful of trading partners, that would be a large undertaking."" Rob Wile is a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist covering breaking business stories for NBCNews.com.

President Donald Trump pulled back Wednesday on a series of harsh tariffs targeting friends and foes alike in an audacious bid to remake the global economic order.  Trump's early afternoon announcement followed a harrowing week in which Republican lawmakers and confidants privately warned him that the tariffs could wreck the economy. His own aides had quietly raised alarms about the financial markets before he suspended a tariff regime that he had unveiled with a flourish just one week earlier in a Rose Garden ceremony. Follow live politics coverage here The stock market rose immediately after the about-face, ending days of losses that have forced older Americans who've been sinking their savings into 401(k)s to rethink their retirement plans. Ahead of Trump's announcement, some of his advisers had been in a near panic about the bond markets, according to a senior administration official. Interest rates on 10-year Treasury bonds had been rising, contrary to what normally happens when stock prices fall and investors seek safety in treasuries. The unusual dynamic meant that at the same time the tariffs could push up prices, people would be paying more to buy homes or pay off credit card debt because of higher interest rates. Businesses looking to expand would pay more for new loans. Two of Trump's most senior advisers, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, presented a united front Wednesday, urging him to suspend the tariffs in light of the bond market, the administration official said. In a social media post, Trump announced a 90-day pause that he said he’ll use to negotiate deals with dozens of countries that have expressed openness to revising trade terms that he contends exploit American businesses and workers. One exception is China. Trump upped the tariff on the country’s biggest geopolitical rival to 125%, part of a tit-for-tat escalation in an evolving trade war. Trump reversed course one week after he appeared in the Rose Garden and unveiled his plan to bring jobs back to the United States. Displaying a chart showing the new, elevated tariffs that countries would face, Trump proclaimed, “My fellow Americans, this is Liberation Day.” It proved short-lived. Markets plunged in anticipation of heightened trade wars, wiping out trillions of dollars in wealth. Democrats seized on the issue, looking to undercut a source of Trump’s popular appeal: the view that he can be trusted to steer the nation’s economy.  “Donald Trump’s market crash has vaporized a whopping $104,000 from the average retirement account,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Wednesday on the Senate floor, hours before Trump’s reversal. The episode laid bare the rifts within Trump’s team of senior advisers as the White House struggled to offer a clear, consistent argument about the duration of the tariffs. While Bessent seemed open to negotiations, Peter Navarro, a senior trade adviser, appeared to take a more hard-line posture.  Elon Musk, the billionaire Tesla CEO who has been advising Trump on the government workforce, called Navarro “dumber than a sack of bricks,” while Navarro described Musk as someone who is merely “a car assembler, in many cases.” But the weeklong drama also underscored the peril of a policymaking process that is often tied to the wishes and vagaries of one man: Trump. Asked about the dust-up between Musk and Navarro, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a golf partner of Trump’s, said: “I don’t think it matters. The only one who matters is Trump.” Markets tend to favor predictability, as do business leaders deciding where to build new plants. When Trump sets a course, however, there are bound to be detours. A friend of his who spoke to him in recent days said Trump gave no sign he was about to “back down quickly on this stuff.” Trump believes other countries trade unfairly and sees tariffs as a tool to make the United States more competitive, the person said. “He’s very confident it’s going to work for him,” the person added, speaking on condition of anonymity. And yet in the run-up to Wednesday’s announcement, Trump and his aides were also hearing from GOP lawmakers and outside allies urging an alternative path. One was Larry Kudlow, who hosts a show on Fox Business Network and was a senior economic adviser in Trump’s first term. Kudlow told NBC News that he has had “ongoing” talks with friends in the West Wing about the need to negotiate with other countries before the United States slaps them with tariffs that stand in perpetuity. Describing Trump’s move Wednesday as “fabulous,” Kudlow added: “Dealmaking is the best thing to do. In the last 48 hours, Trump has gone from non-negotiating to negotiating. It’s very clear that Bessent is now the point man on trade. Very clear.” Anxious GOP lawmakers also weighed in. Graham said he spoke to Trump at length Tuesday night and told him he has been hearing from car manufacturers who are worried about how the tariffs would affect their business. BMW operates a plant in Graham’s home state and is one of the companies he said he has spoken to. Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., a lawmaker who was also in touch with the administration, said Tuesday that he planned to have lunch with Bessent. On Wednesday, he told NBC News he was also talking to the White House. Kennedy likened Trump to the “pit bull who caught the car.” Now, he said, the question becomes: “What are you going to do with the car?” After more market losses this week, and with pressure mounting from Republicans on Capitol Hill, Trump began having second thoughts. In his first term, he often viewed the ups and downs of the stock market as a kind of report card on his presidency, celebrating its rise. The downturn had gotten his attention. “People were getting a little queasy,” he acknowledged Wednesday at an event with NASCAR racing champions. ""Over the last few days,"" he began to more seriously consider pausing the additional tariffs, he told reporters later in the day in an Oval Office appearance. One prospect that intrigued him was personally negotiating new trade deals with the countries looking to get out from under the tariffs, the senior administration official said. He'd made up his mind. Sitting with Bessent and Lutnick, he crafted the note announcing the 90-day postponement and ending, for the time being, the biggest economic crisis of his young presidency. “We wrote it from our hearts, right?” Trump said. “It was written as something that I think was very positive for the world and for us, and we don’t want to hurt countries that don’t need to be hurt, and they all want to negotiate.” The day closed with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up nearly 8%, erasing some — but not all — of the post-“Liberation Day” losses. Messy as it all may have seemed, his administration insisted that all is unfolding as planned. ""You have been watching the greatest economic master strategy from an American President in history,"" White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller posted Wednesday afternoon.

638,"Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News  news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time President Donald Trump directed federal agencies Wednesday to revoke the security clearances and review the activities of two high-level former government officials who questioned his election fraud claims and his conduct in his first term. Christopher Krebs, the former head of the federal government's top cybersecurity agency, said Joe Biden won the 2020 elections, contradicting Trump's claim that the election was stolen.  Miles Taylor, a former Department of Homeland Security official, wrote an anonymous memoir that criticized Trump's handling of classified documents and other conduct during his first term. One memorandum Trump signed directed the attorney general and the homeland security secretary to ""take all appropriate action to review"" Krebs' activities. Another directed the homeland security secretary to review Taylor’s activities as a government employee. The memo relating to Krebs described him as a ""significant bad-faith actor who weaponized and abused his Government authority.""  The other memo said Taylor ""stoked dissension by manufacturing sensationalist reports on the existence of a supposed 'resistance' within the Federal Government."" Krebs declined to comment. Taylor said on X that he wasn't surprised by Trump's actions.  “I said this would happen,” Taylor wrote. “Dissent isn’t unlawful. It certainly isn’t treasonous. America is headed down a dark path.” He added: “Never has a man so inelegantly proved another man’s point.” Taylor wrote an anonymous op-ed while he was working at the Department of Homeland Security in which he said many senior administration officials were trying to limit Trump’s impulses and frustrate his agenda.  In his memoir, Taylor describes having heard about Trump’s interest in “tapping” White House aides’ phones in a bid to stanch media leaks. Krebs was the first director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, which during the Trump administration began offering cybersecurity and physical security help to state and local election officials.  Trump fired Krebs in a tweet in November 2020 over the agency’s Rumor Control website, which corrected falsehoods about election integrity, many of which Trump and his allies promoted. Krebs was among the most vocal government officials debunking baseless claims about election manipulation, particularly addressing a conspiracy theory centered on Dominion Voting Systems machines that Trump's lawyers have pushed. As a prominent critic of Trump’s false claims that the election 2020 was stolen, Krebs has been a consistent target for Trump.  Rep. Jim Himes, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, condemned Trump’s attack on Krebs. “Krebs executed his constitutional and professional duty by debunking lies about the 2020 election,"" Hime said in an email. ""That Donald Trump would wield the Justice Department against him for such an act represents yet another chilling step towards authoritarianism.""

637,"Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News  news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time In the wake of President Donald Trump’s announcement Wednesday afternoon that he was pausing country-by-country tariffs by 90 days, some experts — as well as critics of Trump and social media users — are raising questions about a statement he posted earlier in the day that may have indicated the massive sell-off in stocks in recent days was coming to an end.   Not long after trading opened at 9:30 a.m. Wednesday, Trump took to his Truth Social platform and wrote: “BE COOL! Everything is going to work out well. The USA will be bigger and better than ever before!” Four minutes later, he wrote: “THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!! DJT” Just before 1:30 p.m., Trump announced the pause, sending stocks soaring. The tech-heavy Nasdaq index had its biggest one-day gain since 2008, rising nearly 12%, while the S&P 500 climbed 9.5% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 8%, or about 2,800 points.  Trump could have been generally urging people to buy into the market while prices were relatively low. That was the response Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick gave when he was asked about the posts Wednesday evening on CNBC. “Donald Trump understands that … America is the greatest country, all right? We are the greatest country, and we have the capacity for incredible greatness. But someone needs to take the shackles off.” But on social media, some users raised the prospect — without evidence — of market manipulation, while others began referring to the market’s sharp turn upward as the “Trump Pump.”    There is no evidence to suggest that Trump was seeking to manipulate markets or that he or any of his advisers acted on inside information For Richard Painter, chief ethics lawyer for former President George W. Bush, who now teaches government ethics and security regulation at the University of Minnesota’s law school, the morning posts, at a minimum, leave Trump open to questions about his intentions.   “This is a scenario that could expose the president to accusations that he engaged in market manipulation,” Painter said.  Even before he’d been sworn in for his second term, Trump faced insider-trading criticisms amid the launch of his $TRUMP meme coin. In that incident, the Trump Organization was explicit that a group of investors who were helping launch the coin stood to benefit from its release assuming its price went up. Still, reports showed other investors reaping outsized profits from the launch, including one crypto-wallet owner or owners who earned $109 million, according to a New York Times analysis. Some Democrats were quick to blast Trump’s actions on Wednesday. ""An insider trading scandal is brewing,"" Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., posted on X. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., told NBC News that the Trump administration is “replete with grifters” and that “corruption is its middle name.”  “Insider trading is a real threat, and I hope there will be a surge of penetrating investigations into the potential for manipulation and insider trading of securities,” Blumenthal said, “since the knowledge of what Trump’s plans have been and may be is widely spread.” Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif. — a frequent object of Trump’s scorn — also suggested an inquiry was warranted. “Trump is creating giant market fluctuations with his on-again, off-again tariffs,” Schiff wrote on social media. “These constant gyrations in policy provide dangerous opportunities for insider trading. Who in the administration knew about Trump’s latest tariff flip flop ahead of time? Did anyone buy or sell  stocks, and profit at the public’s expense? I’m writing to the White House — the public has a right to know.” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., pointed to the upcoming May 15 deadline for members of Congress to submit their financial disclosure reports, writing on X, ""Any member of Congress who purchased stocks in the last 48 hours should probably disclose that now. I’ve been hearing some interesting chatter on the floor."" A White House spokesman rejected the Democrats’ assertions. “It is the responsibility of the President of the United States to reassure the markets and Americans about their economic security in the face of nonstop media fearmongering,” White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement. “Instead of grasping at straws to try landing a punch on President Trump, Democrats should focus on working with the administration to restore American Greatness.” A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment. The Securities and Exchange Commission did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Painter said the incident could result in investigations “into who knew what and when before [Trump] announced he was going to postpone the tariffs on all the countries except for China.” “This was a terrible idea to make those posts,” Painter said of Trump’s suggestion that it was “a great time to buy.”  Painter further admonished Trump, saying, “I would hope that he would focus on doing his job — and try to calm the markets and have a predictable trade policy and let the markets do their thing without the White House giving what appears to be investment advice.” Rob Wile is a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist covering breaking business stories for NBCNews.com. © 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"
636,"Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News  news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton’s attempt to topple Republican Sen. John Cornyn in a Senate primary next year kicks off one of the most intense contests of the 2026 elections — a GOP-versus-GOP battle between two men who have been sparring for years and vying for President Donald Trump’s attention.   Cornyn is a fixture of the Republican Party in Texas, serving in its highest offices for more than 30 years and becoming a key voice on Capitol Hill. Paxton, the third-term attorney general who survived a bipartisan impeachment last year in part thanks to support from Trump and conservative activist allies, believes there’s an opening to cut the incumbent down from the right.  Now, both sides are aligning themselves with Trump amid the possibility of an endorsement that could tip the primary.  Whether one comes or not, one thing is clear. “This is gonna be the nastiest race in the modern era of Texas politics, period,” former Travis County GOP chairman Matt Mackowiak said.   Paxton immediately attacked Cornyn for having “turned his back on President Trump,” pointing to comments Cornyn made in 2023 about Trump’s indictment over his handling of classified documents, as well as the senator’s comments that he didn’t think Trump “could win the presidency” after Trump was found liable for sexual abuse in a civil case that same year. Paxton has also targeted Cornyn over his votes on issues including guns and immigration to try to argue that he is more aligned with conservative values. “While John was criticizing Trump and suggesting he shouldn’t run, I was at Mar-a-Lago” for Trump’s presidential announcement speech, Paxton told “The Mark Davis Show” in Dallas.   ""If he had the record of [Texas GOP Sen.] Ted Cruz, would I be here? Absolutely not,"" Paxton continued. ""This isn’t about what he’s saying and the love he suddenly has for President Trump and the love he has for all of our issues now. This isn’t about that love. I don’t believe that love, I believe in action."" Cornyn, though, also made an appeal to Trump’s interests, telling reporters at the Capitol on Wednesday that Paxton’s Senate bid is a “con man’s vanity project.”   “The biggest potential loser is President Trump’s agenda,” Cornyn said of the primary challenge.  “Mr. Paxton has a checkered background, he is a con man and a fraud, and I think the people of Texas know that, but this is what will be litigated during the course of this campaign. I am not going to turn over the Senate seat that was once held by Sam Houston to someone like him,” he added, a reference to the 2023 impeachment trial of Paxton, after which he survived a conviction vote in the state Senate.    “It’s unclear to me exactly what is motivating Mr. Paxton other than vanity and personal ambition,” Cornyn continued.  In the months before Paxton jumped in — and in the hours since — Cornyn has made clear he’s hugging Trump as tight as he can. He posted on X a photo of him reading Trump’s “The Art of the Deal” and called it “recommended” reading; he took to the Senate floor to defend Trump aide and billionaire Elon Musk (whose businesses have a significant footprint in Texas) after protests at Tesla dealerships; and he has been framing himself as one of Trump’s top allies in the Senate.   The roots of this clash between another establishment-insurgent pair of Republicans run deep, part of a decade-plus battle within the Texas GOP that has ousted legislative leaders, fueled Cruz's rise, fanned the flames of Paxton’s impeachment, and led to proxy wars up and down the ballot.   Paxton had been telegraphing a run against Cornyn from the right for more than a year. In early 2024, Paxton lambasted the senator as “anti-Trump [and] anti-gun” in a post on X, adding that “Texans deserve another conservative Senator.”   Cornyn reposted the message and replied: “Hard to run from prison, Ken,” a reference to the investigations that led to the impeachment trial. (The Associated Press reported this month that the Justice Department decided last year not to prosecute Paxton over corruption allegations.)  Brendan Steinhauser, a longtime GOP consultant who served as Cornyn’s campaign manager in the past but is unaffiliated in this race, told NBC News it’s no surprise to see Cornyn campaign with an eye on Trump.   “If you’re Senator Cornyn, you’re going to be campaigning on all the ways that you have supported and worked with the president, you’re going to talk about all the policies where you align, you’re going to talk about helping to get all of his judicial nominees through,” he said.  While a potential endorsement from Trump remains a major question, Cornyn does have support from Senate Republicans. Sen. Tim Scott, of South Carolina, who chairs the National Republican Senatorial Committee, has made his case for Cornyn to White House officials. Scott also told Rep. Wesley Hunt, R-Texas, who has also been weighing a Senate run, that the NRSC is behind Cornyn, according to a source familiar with the discussions.   “John Cornyn is a leader who delivers on President Trump’s agenda and for the people of Texas in the U.S. Senate,” Scott said in a statement to NBC News. “He’s a proven fighter, man of faith and essential part of the Republican Senate Majority.”   Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., has also been publicly backing Cornyn and recently told CNN he was hopeful Trump would back Cornyn in the race.   Asked Wednesday if he has personally asked Trump to endorse Cornyn, Thune told reporters at the Capitol: “Well, we’re having conversations about all of the races on the map. When we have anything to report, we’ll let you know.”  Senate Leadership Fund, the main GOP super PAC involved in Senate races, which is aligned with Republican leadership, indicated it is also in Cornyn's corner. ""Leader John Thune, NRSC Chairman Tim Scott, and many of their colleagues have expressed great admiration and support for Senator John Cornyn and his years of service to the people of Texas,"" SLF Chairman Cory Gardner, a former senator from Colorado, said in a statement to NBC News. ""The Senate Leadership Fund fully intends on seeing him reelected next November."" Mackowiak, a longtime Texas political consultant, told NBC News that he sees Paxton’s early announcement as an indication of two things: The attorney general sees an opening, but he knows he needs time to raise the money required to combat Cornyn and the power of incumbency.   “Paxton’s never run a race this complicated, this expensive against someone as accomplished and serious as John Cornyn,"" he said. ""John Cornyn has never been challenged by someone that has the statewide profile and grassroots enthusiasm Paxton has.""  But Mackowiak argued that while Paxton has sought to go on offense early, that dynamic may not stick, and that the events that led to Paxton’s impeachment trial (which divided Republicans in the state) will likely be relitigated.   “He is going to be playing a lot more defense than he even understands. I think because he got through impeachment, these issues are behind him. They’re not,” he said.   One potential wrinkle, particularly if Hunt or another Republican decides to jump in, is Texas’ runoff rules. If no candidate wins the majority of the vote in the primary, the top two move on to a one-on-one runoff election.   Cornyn has never lost an election in Texas, and he’s never been forced to a runoff by any of his opponents (who have largely challenged him from the right). But the prospect of a split field leading to a runoff is another complicating factor, with both Mackowiak and Steinhauser noting that runoff electorates typically favor the candidate with more grassroots conservative support.  The Texas race could have broader implications for the fight for the Senate next year as Republicans look to defend their slim majority.    Democrats need to net three seats to take control of the Senate, but they face an uphill battle with a short list of targets. Just one Republican — Maine’s Susan Collins — is running in a state that former Vice President Kamala Harris carried in November. Republicans, meanwhile, are looking to grow their majority by targeting Democratic-held seats in battleground states.  But Cornyn said a competitive election in Texas could put a strain on Republicans nationally by diverting money away from other key battlegrounds.   “We’re going to end up spending hundreds of millions of dollars, potentially, on this race in Texas, because we can’t lose the seat in Texas,” said Cornyn, a former NRSC chairman. “And that is money that can’t be used in places like Michigan, New Hampshire and Georgia in the midterm elections.”  Democrats have long coveted the idea of flipping Texas, with former Rep. Beto O’Rourke coming close to defeating Cruz in the blue wave year of 2018. But Trump expanded his margin last year in Texas compared to 2020, carrying Texas by 14 percentage points as Cruz defeated former Democratic Rep. Colin Allred by 9 points.  Allred told The Dallas Morning News last month that he is “seriously considering” another run for Senate against Cornyn. Cruz, meanwhile, told reporters Wednesday that he is staying neutral in this year’s Senate primary, saying both Paxton and Cornyn are friends.   “I have worked closely with both of them. I respect them both,” Cruz said. “And I trust the voters of Texas to make that decision.”  A divisive GOP primary could play into Democrats’ hands — especially if Paxton is the nominee. In the meantime, Democrats are watching the GOP primary process play out in Texas and other states. Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee spokesperson Maeve Coyle noted that former New Hampshire GOP Gov. Chris Sununu announced Tuesday that he would not be running for that state’s open Senate seat.   “As Republicans face a nasty primary in Texas and an embarrassing recruitment failure in New Hampshire — coupled with a building midterm backlash across the map driven by their threats to Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and their push to spike costs for families — Democrats will look for every opportunity to put them on defense,” Coyle said.

642,"Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News  news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time A bipartisan team of freshman senators who went through some of 2024’s biggest battleground races is introducing a bill Wednesday to give President Donald Trump’s administration the power to stop investments from Chinese companies in the U.S. Sens. Bernie Moreno, R-Ohio; Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich.; and Tim Sheehy, R-Mont., are sponsoring the Providing Rigorous Oversight Through Evaluation of Concerning Transactions Act (or PROTECT Act), which would give the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States new authority to stop both entirely new foreign investment projects in the U.S. and foreign investments in existing facilities. The bill would “require the review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States of greenfield and brownfield investments by foreign countries of concern.” The legislation comes after the White House, in a February memo, asked for Congress to “strengthen” CFIUS’ ability to “restrict foreign adversary access to United States talent and operations in sensitive technologies (especially artificial intelligence).” In an interview, Moreno said Congress needs to give Trump “maximum negotiating leverage” to deal with China, and that this legislation contributes to that goal. ""We all went through extremely expensive, extremely tough races,"" Moreno said of the trio of senators introducing the legislation. ""And I think we’re probably the most in tune with what voters are thinking right now."" In a statement, Slotkin described the need for the legislation in national security terms, pointing to the importance of keeping “sensitive American land” out of Chinese, Iranian or North Korean control. “To address that risk, this bipartisan bill builds on my work in the U.S. House and gives more authority to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. to examine a broader set of transactions,” she said. “That means we can stop land purchases that pose an actual risk to our national security.” The senators introduced the legislation the same day Trump’s 104% total tariff on China went into effect — and he raised it to 125% later Wednesday. Meanwhile, China retaliated with a new 84% tariff on U.S. imports. Moreno promoted Trump’s actions and said the senators’ legislation is part of a broader effort to counter China, describing tariffs as “the beginning.” “You had 50 years where China was allowed into the World Trade Organization, they were given most favored nation trading status, and there was a very naive or corrupt, depending on which individual you’re talking about, view that this would be good for America,” Moreno said. “It has been catastrophically bad. We’ve now created a monster.” Last week, Bloomberg reported that China took steps to restrict Chinese companies from investing in the U.S. following Trump's tariff announcement, according to people familiar with the move. “Unfortunately, there’s a strategic adversary, and we have to reset that relationship in a meaningful way,” he continued, adding, “We don’t want to go to war with China, that’s not the goal here. But we have to stop being suckers, as President Trump talks about.” Trump’s global tariffs went into effect Wednesday, as some administration officials suggest there are deals to be made with trading partners while others have said nothing will change the direction of Trump’s tariff agenda. “Well that’s going to be up to President Trump, certainly,” Moreno said. “You hear from his public statements that he’s willing and open to listen to proposals. But obviously, China is a separate situation where we have over $1 trillion in debt.” Allan Smith is a political reporter for NBC News. © 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"
52,"Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton’s attempt to topple Republican Sen. John Cornyn in a Senate primary next year kicks off one of the most intense contests of the 2026 elections — a GOP-versus-GOP battle between two men who have been sparring for years and vying for President Donald Trump’s attention.

Cornyn is a fixture of the Republican Party in Texas, serving in its highest offices for more than 30 years and becoming a key voice on Capitol Hill. Paxton, the third-term attorney general who survived a bipartisan impeachment last year in part thanks to support from Trump and conservative activist allies, believes there’s an opening to cut the incumbent down from the right.

Now, both sides are aligning themselves with Trump amid the possibility of an endorsement that could tip the primary.

Whether one comes or not, one thing is clear. “This is gonna be the nastiest race in the modern era of Texas politics, period,” former Travis County GOP chairman Matt Mackowiak said.

Paxton immediately attacked Cornyn for having “turned his back on President Trump,” pointing to comments Cornyn made in 2023 about Trump’s indictment over his handling of classified documents, as well as the senator’s comments that he didn’t think Trump “could win the presidency” after Trump was found liable for sexual abuse in a civil case that same year.

Paxton has also targeted Cornyn over his votes on issues including guns and immigration to try to argue that he is more aligned with conservative values.

“While John was criticizing Trump and suggesting he shouldn’t run, I was at Mar-a-Lago” for Trump’s presidential announcement speech, Paxton told “The Mark Davis Show” in Dallas.

""If he had the record of [Texas GOP Sen.] Ted Cruz, would I be here? Absolutely not,"" Paxton continued. ""This isn’t about what he’s saying and the love he suddenly has for President Trump and the love he has for all of our issues now. This isn’t about that love. I don’t believe that love, I believe in action.""

Cornyn, though, also made an appeal to Trump’s interests, telling reporters at the Capitol on Wednesday that Paxton’s Senate bid is a “con man’s vanity project.”

“The biggest potential loser is President Trump’s agenda,” Cornyn said of the primary challenge.

“Mr. Paxton has a checkered background, he is a con man and a fraud, and I think the people of Texas know that, but this is what will be litigated during the course of this campaign. I am not going to turn over the Senate seat that was once held by Sam Houston to someone like him,” he added, a reference to the 2023 impeachment trial of Paxton, after which he survived a conviction vote in the state Senate.

“It’s unclear to me exactly what is motivating Mr. Paxton other than vanity and personal ambition,” Cornyn continued.

In the months before Paxton jumped in — and in the hours since — Cornyn has made clear he’s hugging Trump as tight as he can. He posted on X a photo of him reading Trump’s “The Art of the Deal” and called it “recommended” reading; he took to the Senate floor to defend Trump aide and billionaire Elon Musk (whose businesses have a significant footprint in Texas) after protests at Tesla dealerships; and he has been framing himself as one of Trump’s top allies in the Senate.

A long-simmering feud

The roots of this clash between another establishment-insurgent pair of Republicans run deep, part of a decade-plus battle within the Texas GOP that has ousted legislative leaders, fueled Cruz's rise, fanned the flames of Paxton’s impeachment, and led to proxy wars up and down the ballot.

Paxton had been telegraphing a run against Cornyn from the right for more than a year. In early 2024, Paxton lambasted the senator as “anti-Trump [and] anti-gun” in a post on X, adding that “Texans deserve another conservative Senator.”

Cornyn reposted the message and replied: “Hard to run from prison, Ken,” a reference to the investigations that led to the impeachment trial. (The Associated Press reported this month that the Justice Department decided last year not to prosecute Paxton over corruption allegations.)

Brendan Steinhauser, a longtime GOP consultant who served as Cornyn’s campaign manager in the past but is unaffiliated in this race, told NBC News it’s no surprise to see Cornyn campaign with an eye on Trump.

“If you’re Senator Cornyn, you’re going to be campaigning on all the ways that you have supported and worked with the president, you’re going to talk about all the policies where you align, you’re going to talk about helping to get all of his judicial nominees through,” he said.

While a potential endorsement from Trump remains a major question, Cornyn does have support from Senate Republicans. Sen. Tim Scott, of South Carolina, who chairs the National Republican Senatorial Committee, has made his case for Cornyn to White House officials.

Scott also told Rep. Wesley Hunt, R-Texas, who has also been weighing a Senate run, that the NRSC is behind Cornyn, according to a source familiar with the discussions.

“John Cornyn is a leader who delivers on President Trump’s agenda and for the people of Texas in the U.S. Senate,” Scott said in a statement to NBC News. “He’s a proven fighter, man of faith and essential part of the Republican Senate Majority.”

Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., has also been publicly backing Cornyn and recently told CNN he was hopeful Trump would back Cornyn in the race.

Asked Wednesday if he has personally asked Trump to endorse Cornyn, Thune told reporters at the Capitol: “Well, we’re having conversations about all of the races on the map. When we have anything to report, we’ll let you know.”

Senate Leadership Fund, the main GOP super PAC involved in Senate races, which is aligned with Republican leadership, indicated it is also in Cornyn's corner.

""Leader John Thune, NRSC Chairman Tim Scott, and many of their colleagues have expressed great admiration and support for Senator John Cornyn and his years of service to the people of Texas,"" SLF Chairman Cory Gardner, a former senator from Colorado, said in a statement to NBC News. ""The Senate Leadership Fund fully intends on seeing him reelected next November.""

Mackowiak, a longtime Texas political consultant, told NBC News that he sees Paxton’s early announcement as an indication of two things: The attorney general sees an opening, but he knows he needs time to raise the money required to combat Cornyn and the power of incumbency.

“Paxton’s never run a race this complicated, this expensive against someone as accomplished and serious as John Cornyn,"" he said. ""John Cornyn has never been challenged by someone that has the statewide profile and grassroots enthusiasm Paxton has.""

But Mackowiak argued that while Paxton has sought to go on offense early, that dynamic may not stick, and that the events that led to Paxton’s impeachment trial (which divided Republicans in the state) will likely be relitigated.

“He is going to be playing a lot more defense than he even understands. I think because he got through impeachment, these issues are behind him. They’re not,” he said.

One potential wrinkle, particularly if Hunt or another Republican decides to jump in, is Texas’ runoff rules. If no candidate wins the majority of the vote in the primary, the top two move on to a one-on-one runoff election.

Cornyn has never lost an election in Texas, and he’s never been forced to a runoff by any of his opponents (who have largely challenged him from the right). But the prospect of a split field leading to a runoff is another complicating factor, with both Mackowiak and Steinhauser noting that runoff electorates typically favor the candidate with more grassroots conservative support.

Senate map

The Texas race could have broader implications for the fight for the Senate next year as Republicans look to defend their slim majority.

Democrats need to net three seats to take control of the Senate, but they face an uphill battle with a short list of targets. Just one Republican — Maine’s Susan Collins — is running in a state that former Vice President Kamala Harris carried in November. Republicans, meanwhile, are looking to grow their majority by targeting Democratic-held seats in battleground states.

But Cornyn said a competitive election in Texas could put a strain on Republicans nationally by diverting money away from other key battlegrounds.

“We’re going to end up spending hundreds of millions of dollars, potentially, on this race in Texas, because we can’t lose the seat in Texas,” said Cornyn, a former NRSC chairman. “And that is money that can’t be used in places like Michigan, New Hampshire and Georgia in the midterm elections.”

Democrats have long coveted the idea of flipping Texas, with former Rep. Beto O’Rourke coming close to defeating Cruz in the blue wave year of 2018. But Trump expanded his margin last year in Texas compared to 2020, carrying Texas by 14 percentage points as Cruz defeated former Democratic Rep. Colin Allred by 9 points.

Allred told The Dallas Morning News last month that he is “seriously considering” another run for Senate against Cornyn. Cruz, meanwhile, told reporters Wednesday that he is staying neutral in this year’s Senate primary, saying both Paxton and Cornyn are friends.

“I have worked closely with both of them. I respect them both,” Cruz said. “And I trust the voters of Texas to make that decision.”

A divisive GOP primary could play into Democrats’ hands — especially if Paxton is the nominee. In the meantime, Democrats are watching the GOP primary process play out in Texas and other states. Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee spokesperson Maeve Coyle noted that former New Hampshire GOP Gov. Chris Sununu announced Tuesday that he would not be running for that state’s open Senate seat.

“As Republicans face a nasty primary in Texas and an embarrassing recruitment failure in New Hampshire — coupled with a building midterm backlash across the map driven by their threats to Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and their push to spike costs for families — Democrats will look for every opportunity to put them on defense,” Coyle said."

774,"Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News  news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Gretchen Whitmer became governor after promising to “fix the damn roads” in Michigan.  Whether she goes any further depends on how well she can navigate some of the early bumps surfacing as she positions herself for a possible White House bid. On Wednesday, during a trip to Washington, D.C., that put a spotlight on her prospects in 2028, Whitmer hit what many of her fellow Democrats saw as two sizable potholes. First, in a policy speech outlining a “consistent national strategy,” Whitmer staked out common ground with President Donald Trump. And though Whitmer criticized Trump’s sweeping, roller-coaster rollout of — and subsequent retreat from — tariffs, she said she was not against tariffs “outright” and expressed understanding of Trump’s “motivation” behind deploying them. That drew a social media rebuke from Colorado’s Democratic governor, Jared Polis. “Tariffs are bad outright because they lead to higher prices and destroy American manufacturing,” Polis, another potential 2028 contender who has also sought ways to find common cause with Trump, wrote on X. “Trade is inherently good because both parties emerge better off from a consensual transaction.” Then, later Wednesday, Whitmer joined Trump in the Oval Office. She was scheduled to meet privately with him and discuss Michigan issues. That wasn’t how it ultimately played out.  Instead, she stood by as he signed several executive orders, including two calling for Justice Department probes of officials who served in his first administration and called him out for falsely claiming the 2020 election was stolen. He made the false claims about the election’s being “rigged” again Wednesday. Whitmer was invited into the Oval Office alongside Michigan state House Speaker Matt Hall, a Republican, as Trump held court with reporters and signed the executive orders. Photos showed Whitmer standing uncomfortably against a door as the cameras rolled. “She’s really done an excellent job,” Trump said of Whitmer during the impromptu media availability. “Very good person.” Though Trump did engage with her on issues she came to discuss, the fact that she was present at what amounted to a bipartisan photo opportunity as he took actions targeting political critics angered and confused allies. “Just a f---ing disaster,” said a Democratic operative who admires Whitmer and, like others interviewed for this article, was granted anonymity to share candid thoughts about her day. “It feels like it removes some of the momentum she had as a politically savvy swing-state Dem.” Whitmer’s team moved quickly to contain the fallout and counter mounting criticism from within her party. “The governor was surprised that she was brought into the Oval Office during President Trump’s press conference without any notice of the subject matter,” a Whitmer spokesperson said in a statement. “Her presence is not an endorsement of the actions taken or statements made at that event.” Democrats have long seen Whitmer as one of the party’s more formidable figures — a two-term governor of a battleground state who won re-election in a landslide and was nearly tapped to be Joe Biden’s running mate in 2020 after having considerably raised her public profile during the Covid pandemic. Whitmer is among a handful of prominent Democratic governors viewed as potential presidential contenders in 2028. But unlike some of her contemporaries, Whitmer has chosen to seek out a stronger working relationship with Trump in his second term. Trump won her state last fall, and Whitmer views herself as more of a center-left moderate with a middle-of-the-road, Midwestern constituency — one that is receptive to Trump’s message, including and especially on manufacturing and tariff policy.  In her Washington speech Wednesday, Whitmer called for cutting red tape and building more in the United States. She also railed against “partisanship,” saying it has seemingly “infected every aspect of our lives, and it’s exhausting.” “Let’s give more hard-working people a fair shot at a decent life,” she said. “And let’s usher in, as President Trump says, a ‘Golden Age’ of American manufacturing.” She did break with Trump on the more substantial tariffs he announced last week and partially paused later Wednesday afternoon, describing them as a “triple whammy: higher costs, fewer jobs and more uncertainty.” “I understand the motivation behind the tariffs, and I can tell you here’s where President Trump and I do agree,” she said. “We do need to make more stuff in America — more cars and chips, more steel and ships. We do need fair trade.” Her stance on tariffs puts her at odds with other potential Democratic presidential hopefuls, like Polis and Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, who offered sharp criticism of Trump’s “wrongheaded” measures in a speech in his state Wednesday. During a question-and-answer session with journalist Gretchen Carlson after her speech, Whitmer empathized with the many Democrats who don’t want Democratic officials to work with Trump. But she said she needs to be collaborative because “I took an oath to the people of Michigan to try to get as much done for the state.” Whitmer also said she hadn’t “thought through” how she’d handle tariffs differently from Trump, only that they should be used as a “scalpel.” A national Democratic strategist said, “It is a massive indictment on Whitmer and her team’s judgment to, first, not have an answer on the tariff question and then go the White House and get absolutely played by Donald Trump to the point she is caught in the Oval Office as he signs one of his revenge and retribution executive orders and says 2020 was rigged.”  About tariffs, her spokesperson emphasized areas of disagreement with Trump rather than ways the two overlap on the policy.  “This morning, the governor delivered a speech in Washington, D.C., about the devastating effects tariffs were having on Michiganders — from companies increasing prices and laying off workers to retirement accounts being wiped out,” Whitmer’s spokesperson said. “This afternoon, the 90-day pause was announced, and that is a step in the right direction and will provide relief to so many businesses across the state, but we remain concerned about tariffs that will hurt American auto companies.” Whitmer and Hall were supposed to discuss with Trump federal investment at Michigan’s Selfridge Air National Guard Base, a recent devastating ice storm in the state and a plan to deal with invasive Asian carp in Lake Michigan. Whitmer’s team and her allies described the meeting as a success on those matters. “Governor Whitmer thanks President Trump for his acknowledgements on protecting the Great Lakes from invasive carp, his work on Selfridge, and his openness to our request for help in northern Michigan,” her spokesperson said. A Democratic official who used to work with Whitmer said her dealings with Trump show she “is very good at advocating for her state.” “And President Trump clearly listens to what she says and what she does,” this person said. “You saw that today on tariffs, on the progress they made on Selfridge and on the other issues she brought to discuss.” Whitmer’s day also offered some political nuance. Her visit to the Oval Office didn’t annoy just Democrats. Republicans complained that it was an unnecessary boost to a leader they have long tried to demonize in a crucial electoral battleground. “Trump literally just f---ed Republicans in Michigan by saying Whitmer is doing an excellent job,” a Republican strategist from Michigan wrote in a text message. “I mean, WTF, she is running to replace him in 2028.” The budding Trump-Whitmer relationship — Wednesday’s meeting was their second in less than two months — would have been unthinkable not so long ago. Trump figured prominently in the political memoir Whitmer published last year, with a long-standing feud between them accounting for a large share of the first chapter: “Don’t Let the Bullies Get You Down.”  Whitmer wrote about how Trump responded to her criticism of his leadership during the early days of the pandemic by branding her dismissively and derisively as “that woman from Michigan.” Whitmer and her team embraced the insulting sobriquet, which became a staple in progressive merchandising. “That’s the secret to dealing with bullies: You take their weapon and make it your shield,” Whitmer wrote. “Every time Trump gave me a nickname, I made it my own.” That history had some observers struggling with cognitive dissonance Wednesday. “Whitmer hurt her candidacy today,” a Democratic strategist said. “She looked and sounded nervous in the Oval Office. That visual will stick. So will the image of Trump praising her as he signed executive orders targeting his critics.”  A second Democratic operative who has worked with Whitmer previously said her speech today felt like an “opening salvo” for a presidential bid. “There’s sort of this absolutism among Democrats where you’re either all against him or you’re not against him enough, right?” this person said. “And I think if you are a Midwestern governor, there are certainly appropriate times to be for tariffs.”  This person was surprised at the pushback she got from Polis after her address, adding that criticism showed “2028 is on.” But the person was also perplexed by Whitmer’s Oval Office appearance. “It overall seemed not great,” this person said. “The photo of her standing there in the corner looking uncomfortable. The odd banter. The whole thing didn’t make a lot of sense. Why did it happen? Whose idea was that?” Still, this person said Whitmer, who has pledged to work across the aisle, including with Trump, to deliver results for her state, can point to tangible results from her trip to Michiganders.  But nationally, the conversation around her visit will be very different. “Overall, hey, great visit, right?” this person continued, rattling off the local issues Whitmer went to discuss — before pivoting to the executive order spectacle. “It felt like, holy s---, what just happened?” Allan Smith is a political reporter for NBC News.

777,"Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News  news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time HONG KONG — The increasingly vicious trade war between Washington and Beijing took another turn Wednesday when China imposed an additional 50% tariff on imports from the U.S., hiking its levies on American imports to 84%. The tit-for-tat escalation came hours after President Donald Trump’s 104% tariffs on Chinese imports went into effect, including 50% Trump added Monday. Later Wednesday, Trump increased the overall U.S. tariff on Chinese goods to 125%, even as he paused higher targeted tariffs on other countries for 90 days while keeping a 10% baseline tariff in place for all countries. Trump’s 50% tariff is a “mistake upon another mistake,” China’s Customs Tariff Commission said in a statement earlier Wednesday, adding that the world’s two biggest economies should “resolve differences through equal dialogue based on mutual respect.”  The effect of China’s 84% tariff may be somewhat limited because China imports only about $160 billion a year in U.S. goods compared with the more than $400 billion in goods it exports to the U.S. “I don’t think they can match in the economic realm, because the relationship is so unbalanced,” said Rick Waters, the Singapore-based director of the Carnegie China think tank. “So what they tend to do is move into adjacent realms to exact a price.”  Here's a look at some of the other measures China might take.  China could greatly increase tariffs on U.S. agricultural products, or even stop importing them completely. “I think there’s a very high chance that China will stop agricultural imports from the U.S. altogether,” said Tianchen Xu, a Beijing-based economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit, a financial forecasting service. “It’s a weapon targeting Trump’s supporter base,” he added.  Soybeans, which are crushed to make protein-rich animal feed ingredients and vegetable oils, have been at the heart of the U.S.-China trade dispute for some time. U.S. exports of soybeans to China fell 75% after China imposed a retaliatory 25% tariff on them in 2018, during Trump’s first-term trade war with Beijing. The Trump administration announced $12 billion in subsidies for farmers to offset the impact, and it has again promised to step in if the latest round of tariffs hurts the industry further. China could also put further restrictions on American poultry products, having announced an import ban on two U.S. companies last week. China, which frequently trades places with North America as the world’s largest box office, is a crucial market for Hollywood films. Though China has an annual quota for the number of foreign movies that can appear in its theaters, it could ban Hollywood films altogether. American movies have already been declining in popularity in recent years as U.S.-China trade tensions have escalated. There were no Hollywood films among China’s 10 highest-grossing movies in 2023, in stark contrast to 2012, when seven of the top 10 highest-grossing movies were U.S.-made, according to Maoyan, a Chinese movie-ticketing and data platform.  The U.S. has a large trade deficit with China in goods, but it comes out ahead when it comes to services such as finance, consulting and law. U.S. data lists China as its fifth-largest export market for services, according to a report by China’s State Council released Wednesday. China could target the U.S. services sector, for example, by excluding American companies from government procurement processes or restricting their cooperation with Chinese firms. The U.S. has long accused China of stealing its intellectual property. But Beijing also has its own growing intellectual property interests, and it could investigate U.S. companies in China in an effort to protect them. China and the U.S. have made progress on stemming the international flow of precursor ingredients for fentanyl, some of which originate in China and are then processed into the deadly opioid in countries such as Mexico before being smuggled into the U.S.  But China could bring that cooperation to a halt in response to Trump’s tariffs. “Out of humanitarian considerations, China has provided various forms of assistance to the U.S.,” Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said last month. “The U.S. should not repay goodwill with hostility.” Waters said it would be “counterproductive” for China to suspend cooperation on fentanyl. “It’s just going to cement narratives in the U.S. that they’re weaponizing drugs against us,” he said.

775,"Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News  news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time WASHINGTON — “Liberation Day” just gave way to Capitulation Day. President Donald Trump pulled back Wednesday on a series of harsh tariffs targeting friends and foes alike in an audacious bid to remake the global economic order.  Trump's early afternoon announcement followed a harrowing week in which Republican lawmakers and confidants privately warned him that the tariffs could wreck the economy. His own aides had quietly raised alarms about the financial markets before he suspended a tariff regime that he had unveiled with a flourish just one week earlier in a Rose Garden ceremony. Follow live politics coverage here The stock market rose immediately after the about-face, ending days of losses that have forced older Americans who've been sinking their savings into 401(k)s to rethink their retirement plans. Ahead of Trump's announcement, some of his advisers had been in a near panic about the bond markets, according to a senior administration official. Interest rates on 10-year Treasury bonds had been rising, contrary to what normally happens when stock prices fall and investors seek safety in treasuries. The unusual dynamic meant that at the same time the tariffs could push up prices, people would be paying more to buy homes or pay off credit card debt because of higher interest rates. Businesses looking to expand would pay more for new loans. Two of Trump's most senior advisers, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, presented a united front Wednesday, urging him to suspend the tariffs in light of the bond market, the administration official said. In a social media post, Trump announced a 90-day pause that he said he’ll use to negotiate deals with dozens of countries that have expressed openness to revising trade terms that he contends exploit American businesses and workers. One exception is China. Trump upped the tariff on the country’s biggest geopolitical rival to 125%, part of a tit-for-tat escalation in an evolving trade war. Trump reversed course one week after he appeared in the Rose Garden and unveiled his plan to bring jobs back to the United States. Displaying a chart showing the new, elevated tariffs that countries would face, Trump proclaimed, “My fellow Americans, this is Liberation Day.” It proved short-lived. Markets plunged in anticipation of heightened trade wars, wiping out trillions of dollars in wealth. Democrats seized on the issue, looking to undercut a source of Trump’s popular appeal: the view that he can be trusted to steer the nation’s economy.  “Donald Trump’s market crash has vaporized a whopping $104,000 from the average retirement account,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Wednesday on the Senate floor, hours before Trump’s reversal. The episode laid bare the rifts within Trump’s team of senior advisers as the White House struggled to offer a clear, consistent argument about the duration of the tariffs. While Bessent seemed open to negotiations, Peter Navarro, a senior trade adviser, appeared to take a more hard-line posture.  Elon Musk, the billionaire Tesla CEO who has been advising Trump on the government workforce, called Navarro “dumber than a sack of bricks,” while Navarro described Musk as someone who is merely “a car assembler, in many cases.” But the weeklong drama also underscored the peril of a policymaking process that is often tied to the wishes and vagaries of one man: Trump. Asked about the dust-up between Musk and Navarro, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a golf partner of Trump’s, said: “I don’t think it matters. The only one who matters is Trump.” Markets tend to favor predictability, as do business leaders deciding where to build new plants. When Trump sets a course, however, there are bound to be detours. A friend of his who spoke to him in recent days said Trump gave no sign he was about to “back down quickly on this stuff.” Trump believes other countries trade unfairly and sees tariffs as a tool to make the United States more competitive, the person said. “He’s very confident it’s going to work for him,” the person added, speaking on condition of anonymity. And yet in the run-up to Wednesday’s announcement, Trump and his aides were also hearing from GOP lawmakers and outside allies urging an alternative path. One was Larry Kudlow, who hosts a show on Fox Business Network and was a senior economic adviser in Trump’s first term. Kudlow told NBC News that he has had “ongoing” talks with friends in the West Wing about the need to negotiate with other countries before the United States slaps them with tariffs that stand in perpetuity. Describing Trump’s move Wednesday as “fabulous,” Kudlow added: “Dealmaking is the best thing to do. In the last 48 hours, Trump has gone from non-negotiating to negotiating. It’s very clear that Bessent is now the point man on trade. Very clear.” Anxious GOP lawmakers also weighed in. Graham said he spoke to Trump at length Tuesday night and told him he has been hearing from car manufacturers who are worried about how the tariffs would affect their business. BMW operates a plant in Graham’s home state and is one of the companies he said he has spoken to. Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., a lawmaker who was also in touch with the administration, said Tuesday that he planned to have lunch with Bessent. On Wednesday, he told NBC News he was also talking to the White House. Kennedy likened Trump to the “pit bull who caught the car.” Now, he said, the question becomes: “What are you going to do with the car?” After more market losses this week, and with pressure mounting from Republicans on Capitol Hill, Trump began having second thoughts. In his first term, he often viewed the ups and downs of the stock market as a kind of report card on his presidency, celebrating its rise. The downturn had gotten his attention. “People were getting a little queasy,” he acknowledged Wednesday at an event with NASCAR racing champions. ""Over the last few days,"" he began to more seriously consider pausing the additional tariffs, he told reporters later in the day in an Oval Office appearance. One prospect that intrigued him was personally negotiating new trade deals with the countries looking to get out from under the tariffs, the senior administration official said. He'd made up his mind.

46,"WASHINGTON — As President Donald Trump ramps up attacks on the judiciary, the Republican-led House voted Wednesday to limit district court judges’ ability to issue the nationwide injunctions that have hampered some of his executive actions.

The vote was 219-213, with just one Republican, Mike Turner of Ohio, joining all Democrats in opposing it. The bill now heads to the Senate, where it would almost certainly be blocked by a Democratic filibuster if it were brought to the floor.

Trump and many of his allies on the far right had been pushing House Republicans to take a more extreme step and attempt to impeach judges that stood in his way.

The ""No Rogue Rulings Act,"" authored by Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., doesn’t go that far, but it allows House Republicans to voice their support for Trump on the issue while avoiding politically perilous impeachment votes that would be all but doomed to fail.

In a brief interview, Issa argued that both parties would benefit from the legislation. He said that during President Joe Biden's administration, Democrats howled when conservative judges issued nationwide injunctions against his executive actions.

""This is a growing problem that has vexed both Republican and Democrat presidents,"" Issa, a senior member of the Judiciary Committee and the former chairman of the Oversight Committee, said before the vote. Biden, ""to the very end, was trying to get this process of activist judges exceeding their jurisdiction rolled back.""

This bill, Issa said, ""limits judges to the original intent, which will allow them to make decisions but only as to the plaintiffs.""

Trump and his allies have grown frustrated with lower-court judges’ issuing injunctions blocking Trump’s actions on deportations of undocumented immigrants, sweeping cuts and mass firings at federal agencies, ending birthright citizenship and other matters.

Much of Republicans' criticism has centered on U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, who halted Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants alleged to be Tren de Aragua gang members.

After that decision, Rep. Brandon Gill, R-Texas, a Trump ally, introduced a resolution to impeach Boasberg, who is based in Washington, D.C. Other judges who have ruled against Trump also have faced impeachment threats, including U.S. District Judges Paul A. Engelmayer and John Bates.

But GOP leaders have acknowledged such impeachment resolutions wouldn't have enough support to pass out of the House, where Republicans hold a narrow 220-213 majority.

On top of that, 67 votes would be needed for convictions in the Senate, where Republicans have a 53-47 majority.

In some high-profile cases, the conservative-leaning Supreme Court has been ruling in Trump’s favor. On Monday, it tossed out Boasberg’s decision blocking the removal of the alleged gang members to El Salvador.

A day later, the Supreme Court halted a ruling by U.S. District Judge William Alsup of California requiring some federal agencies to reinstate roughly 16,000 workers the Trump administration had tried to fire.

Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, said his party in the past has tried to block ""judicial forum shopping,"" in which plaintiffs try to pick courts where they have higher chances of winning.

""But a nationwide injunction is a necessary part of the judicial tool kit,"" said Raskin, a former constitutional law professor. ""Why should every person affected [by an issue] have to go to court? Why should millions of people have to create their own case?""

""Why should Brown vs. Board of Education have applied to just Linda Brown as opposed to everybody affected?"" he added."
776,"Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News  news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time President Donald Trump said Wednesday he was pausing higher targeted tariffs for 90 days for most countries, a stunning reversal in his trade war that has sent markets reeling.   Trump wrote on social media just before 1:30 p.m. that he came to the decision because more than 75 trading partners didn’t retaliate and have reached out to the United States to “discuss” some of the issues he had raised.    The pause didn’t apply to China, which has retaliated — with 84% hikes. Trump instead raised duties for it to 125%, effective immediately.    “Based on the lack of respect that China has shown to the World’s Markets, I am hereby raising the Tariff charged to China by the United States of America to 125%, effective immediately,” he wrote. “At some point, hopefully in the near future, China will realize that the days of ripping off the U.S.A., and other Countries, is no longer sustainable or acceptable.”  But the trade war isn’t exactly over, and the pause didn’t return the world to the time before Trump touched off the global instability; a 10% across-the-board duty will remain. For Canada and Mexico, goods covered by the U.S., Canada and Mexico trade agreement will continue to have no tariffs, while products that aren't exempt under the trade deal will have a 25% tariff. Canadian energy and fertilizer products will have a 10% tariff. It wasn’t immediately clear which countries the pause would cover; the White House wouldn’t say. Earlier Wednesday, the European Union voted to impose fresh retaliatory duties, but they aren’t set to take effect until next week.   And separate tariffs on imported autos, steel and aluminum will remain, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said later — while planned tariffs on items like lumber and pharmaceuticals are still on.  It’s not clear what prompted Trump to change his mind — he appeared to dig in just hours earlier, telling Americans “BE COOL” in a Truth Social post, and he suggested not that long ago that the tariffs could be permanent.   “I did a 90-day pause for the people that didn’t retaliate, because I told them, ‘If you retaliate, we’re going to double it,’” Trump said Wednesday. “And that’s what I did with China, because they did retaliate. So we’ll see how it all works out. I think it’s going to work out amazing.”  But markets have been in stunning turmoil — major stock indexes shed trillions of dollars in value, while alarming signals from the bond market set Wall Street on edge.   When a false-at-the-time headline suggesting Trump would take a 90-day pause shot around the internet Monday, markets briefly surged. And a growing chorus of business leaders and Trump’s allies have come out publicly against the tariffs, including Tesla CEO Elon Musk.  Markets soared on the surprising news Wednesday, with the S&P 500 climbing more than 9%, the tech-heavy Nasdaq closing up more than 12% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average ending nearly 3,000 points higher. Among the big gainers: Tesla stock was up 22%. Despite the gains, all three indexes were down from where they were a month ago and at the start of the year, and some investors questioned what the recent volatility could mean for the U.S. stock market longer-term. ""My portfolio of defensive stocks is green so I don’t begrudge today’s market. But I ask you, would you want to own highly volatile US stocks whose price depends on whether POTUS had a good night’s sleep and woke up the next morning to reverse yesterday’s policies?"" billionaire investor Bill Gross said on X. Goldman Sachs lowered its odds of a recession but said it is still forecasting minimal economic growth and a 45% probability of a recession given the remaining tariffs. Borrowing costs — which had surged early Wednesday as the tariffs took effect — also eased slightly, though not substantially, as some investors may fear a lingering fallout.   Trump has been talking about tariffs as the solution for U.S. economic problems since before he became president; he branded April 2 — when he unveiled the plan — “Liberation Day,” saying it would end decades of the country’s being “looted, pillaged, raped and plundered” by other countries.  The global markets recoiled, and last week $6.6 trillion alone was wiped out. Yet Trump and his allies had doubled down until Wednesday, arguing tariffs were necessary to return manufacturing to the United States and fill the nation’s coffers with trillions of dollars in revenue that could be used to pay down debt or offset tax cuts.   It’s not clear how the White House expects the policies to fuel big gains now. With the lower 10% tariff rate left in place, there will be less incentive for companies to relocate production to the United States and less revenue being generated.  After the news, Bessent sought to make the about-face into a negotiating tactic, insisting it was a way to scare countries to come to the negotiating table by demonstrating how high the United States was going to go.    “President Trump created maximum negotiating leverage for himself,” he said.   It’s unclear how successful the United States will be at negotiating new trade agreements with other countries given Trump’s on-again, off-again threats over the past several months. Previously, he had threatened sweeping tariffs on all imports from Mexico and Canada before he walked most of them back.   And while markets surged higher Wednesday following Trump’s pause, economic uncertainty remains over what will come next in the U.S. trade war with China, which exports more than $400 billion worth of goods to the United States each year.   Under Trump’s new tariffs, the cost for U.S. companies importing goods from China has more than doubled. Those products include everything from toys and sneakers to televisions and iPhones.   U.S. companies exporting their products to China are also caught up in the fray after China increased its tariffs on American goods like agriculture products and machinery. But the White House is downplaying that risk.   “What I am certain of is that what China is doing will affect their economy much more than ours because they have an export-driven, flood-the-world-with-cheap-exports model,” Bessent said.  Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said on X that he sat with Trump as he posted the initial message, adding: “The world is ready to work with President Trump to fix global trade, and China has chosen the opposite direction.”  The Trump administration will now face the daunting task of trying to negotiate dozens of potentially complex and intricate trade deals in a three-month period.  ""That is a huge task to negotiate simultaneously with that many trading partners over that many issues,” said Greta Peisch, who was general counsel for the U.S. trade representative’s office during the Biden administration. “We have tariffs, non-tariff barriers, other non-trade related matters, all of those issues can get quite complicated quite quickly. Even with just a handful of trading partners, that would be a large undertaking."" Rob Wile is a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist covering breaking business stories for NBCNews.com.

WASHINGTON — “Liberation Day” just gave way to Capitulation Day.

President Donald Trump pulled back Wednesday on a series of harsh tariffs targeting friends and foes alike in an audacious bid to remake the global economic order.

Trump's early afternoon announcement followed a harrowing week in which Republican lawmakers and confidants privately warned him that the tariffs could wreck the economy. His own aides had quietly raised alarms about the financial markets before he suspended a tariff regime that he had unveiled with a flourish just one week earlier in a Rose Garden ceremony.

The stock market rose immediately after the about-face, ending days of losses that have forced older Americans who've been sinking their savings into 401(k)s to rethink their retirement plans.

Ahead of Trump's announcement, some of his advisers had been in a near panic about the bond markets, according to a senior administration official. Interest rates on 10-year Treasury bonds had been rising, contrary to what normally happens when stock prices fall and investors seek safety in treasuries. The unusual dynamic meant that at the same time the tariffs could push up prices, people would be paying more to buy homes or pay off credit card debt because of higher interest rates. Businesses looking to expand would pay more for new loans.

Two of Trump's most senior advisers, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, presented a united front Wednesday, urging him to suspend the tariffs in light of the bond market, the administration official said.

In a social media post, Trump announced a 90-day pause that he said he’ll use to negotiate deals with dozens of countries that have expressed openness to revising trade terms that he contends exploit American businesses and workers. One exception is China. Trump upped the tariff on the country’s biggest geopolitical rival to 125%, part of a tit-for-tat escalation in an evolving trade war.

Trump reversed course one week after he appeared in the Rose Garden and unveiled his plan to bring jobs back to the United States. Displaying a chart showing the new, elevated tariffs that countries would face, Trump proclaimed, “My fellow Americans, this is Liberation Day.”

It proved short-lived.

Markets plunged in anticipation of heightened trade wars, wiping out trillions of dollars in wealth. Democrats seized on the issue, looking to undercut a source of Trump’s popular appeal: the view that he can be trusted to steer the nation’s economy.

“Donald Trump’s market crash has vaporized a whopping $104,000 from the average retirement account,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Wednesday on the Senate floor, hours before Trump’s reversal.

The episode laid bare the rifts within Trump’s team of senior advisers as the White House struggled to offer a clear, consistent argument about the duration of the tariffs. While Bessent seemed open to negotiations, Peter Navarro, a senior trade adviser, appeared to take a more hard-line posture.

Elon Musk, the billionaire Tesla CEO who has been advising Trump on the government workforce, called Navarro “dumber than a sack of bricks,” while Navarro described Musk as someone who is merely “a car assembler, in many cases.”

But the weeklong drama also underscored the peril of a policymaking process that is often tied to the wishes and vagaries of one man: Trump.

Asked about the dust-up between Musk and Navarro, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a golf partner of Trump’s, said: “I don’t think it matters. The only one who matters is Trump.”

Markets tend to favor predictability, as do business leaders deciding where to build new plants. When Trump sets a course, however, there are bound to be detours.

A friend of his who spoke to him in recent days said Trump gave no sign he was about to “back down quickly on this stuff.”

Trump believes other countries trade unfairly and sees tariffs as a tool to make the United States more competitive, the person said.

“He’s very confident it’s going to work for him,” the person added, speaking on condition of anonymity.

And yet in the run-up to Wednesday’s announcement, Trump and his aides were also hearing from GOP lawmakers and outside allies urging an alternative path.

One was Larry Kudlow, who hosts a show on Fox Business Network and was a senior economic adviser in Trump’s first term.

Kudlow told NBC News that he has had “ongoing” talks with friends in the West Wing about the need to negotiate with other countries before the United States slaps them with tariffs that stand in perpetuity.

Describing Trump’s move Wednesday as “fabulous,” Kudlow added: “Dealmaking is the best thing to do. In the last 48 hours, Trump has gone from non-negotiating to negotiating. It’s very clear that Bessent is now the point man on trade. Very clear.”

Anxious GOP lawmakers also weighed in.

Graham said he spoke to Trump at length Tuesday night and told him he has been hearing from car manufacturers who are worried about how the tariffs would affect their business. BMW operates a plant in Graham’s home state and is one of the companies he said he has spoken to.

Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., a lawmaker who was also in touch with the administration, said Tuesday that he planned to have lunch with Bessent. On Wednesday, he told NBC News he was also talking to the White House. Kennedy likened Trump to the “pit bull who caught the car.” Now, he said, the question becomes: “What are you going to do with the car?”

After more market losses this week, and with pressure mounting from Republicans on Capitol Hill, Trump began having second thoughts. In his first term, he often viewed the ups and downs of the stock market as a kind of report card on his presidency, celebrating its rise. The downturn had gotten his attention.

“People were getting a little queasy,” he acknowledged Wednesday at an event with NASCAR racing champions.

""Over the last few days,"" he began to more seriously consider pausing the additional tariffs, he told reporters later in the day in an Oval Office appearance. One prospect that intrigued him was personally negotiating new trade deals with the countries looking to get out from under the tariffs, the senior administration official said.

He'd made up his mind. Sitting with Bessent and Lutnick, he crafted the note announcing the 90-day postponement and ending, for the time being, the biggest economic crisis of his young presidency.

“We wrote it from our hearts, right?” Trump said. “It was written as something that I think was very positive for the world and for us, and we don’t want to hurt countries that don’t need to be hurt, and they all want to negotiate.”

The day closed with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up nearly 8%, erasing some — but not all — of the post-“Liberation Day” losses.

Messy as it all may have seemed, his administration insisted that all is unfolding as planned.

779,"Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News  news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton’s attempt to topple Republican Sen. John Cornyn in a Senate primary next year kicks off one of the most intense contests of the 2026 elections — a GOP-versus-GOP battle between two men who have been sparring for years and vying for President Donald Trump’s attention.   Cornyn is a fixture of the Republican Party in Texas, serving in its highest offices for more than 30 years and becoming a key voice on Capitol Hill. Paxton, the third-term attorney general who survived a bipartisan impeachment last year in part thanks to support from Trump and conservative activist allies, believes there’s an opening to cut the incumbent down from the right.  Now, both sides are aligning themselves with Trump amid the possibility of an endorsement that could tip the primary.  Whether one comes or not, one thing is clear. “This is gonna be the nastiest race in the modern era of Texas politics, period,” former Travis County GOP chairman Matt Mackowiak said.   Paxton immediately attacked Cornyn for having “turned his back on President Trump,” pointing to comments Cornyn made in 2023 about Trump’s indictment over his handling of classified documents, as well as the senator’s comments that he didn’t think Trump “could win the presidency” after Trump was found liable for sexual abuse in a civil case that same year. Paxton has also targeted Cornyn over his votes on issues including guns and immigration to try to argue that he is more aligned with conservative values. “While John was criticizing Trump and suggesting he shouldn’t run, I was at Mar-a-Lago” for Trump’s presidential announcement speech, Paxton told “The Mark Davis Show” in Dallas.   ""If he had the record of [Texas GOP Sen.] Ted Cruz, would I be here? Absolutely not,"" Paxton continued. ""This isn’t about what he’s saying and the love he suddenly has for President Trump and the love he has for all of our issues now. This isn’t about that love. I don’t believe that love, I believe in action."" Cornyn, though, also made an appeal to Trump’s interests, telling reporters at the Capitol on Wednesday that Paxton’s Senate bid is a “con man’s vanity project.”   “The biggest potential loser is President Trump’s agenda,” Cornyn said of the primary challenge.  “Mr. Paxton has a checkered background, he is a con man and a fraud, and I think the people of Texas know that, but this is what will be litigated during the course of this campaign. I am not going to turn over the Senate seat that was once held by Sam Houston to someone like him,” he added, a reference to the 2023 impeachment trial of Paxton, after which he survived a conviction vote in the state Senate.    “It’s unclear to me exactly what is motivating Mr. Paxton other than vanity and personal ambition,” Cornyn continued.  In the months before Paxton jumped in — and in the hours since — Cornyn has made clear he’s hugging Trump as tight as he can. He posted on X a photo of him reading Trump’s “The Art of the Deal” and called it “recommended” reading; he took to the Senate floor to defend Trump aide and billionaire Elon Musk (whose businesses have a significant footprint in Texas) after protests at Tesla dealerships; and he has been framing himself as one of Trump’s top allies in the Senate.   The roots of this clash between another establishment-insurgent pair of Republicans run deep, part of a decade-plus battle within the Texas GOP that has ousted legislative leaders, fueled Cruz's rise, fanned the flames of Paxton’s impeachment, and led to proxy wars up and down the ballot.   Paxton had been telegraphing a run against Cornyn from the right for more than a year. In early 2024, Paxton lambasted the senator as “anti-Trump [and] anti-gun” in a post on X, adding that “Texans deserve another conservative Senator.”   Cornyn reposted the message and replied: “Hard to run from prison, Ken,” a reference to the investigations that led to the impeachment trial. (The Associated Press reported this month that the Justice Department decided last year not to prosecute Paxton over corruption allegations.)  Brendan Steinhauser, a longtime GOP consultant who served as Cornyn’s campaign manager in the past but is unaffiliated in this race, told NBC News it’s no surprise to see Cornyn campaign with an eye on Trump.   “If you’re Senator Cornyn, you’re going to be campaigning on all the ways that you have supported and worked with the president, you’re going to talk about all the policies where you align, you’re going to talk about helping to get all of his judicial nominees through,” he said.  While a potential endorsement from Trump remains a major question, Cornyn does have support from Senate Republicans. Sen. Tim Scott, of South Carolina, who chairs the National Republican Senatorial Committee, has made his case for Cornyn to White House officials. Scott also told Rep. Wesley Hunt, R-Texas, who has also been weighing a Senate run, that the NRSC is behind Cornyn, according to a source familiar with the discussions.   “John Cornyn is a leader who delivers on President Trump’s agenda and for the people of Texas in the U.S. Senate,” Scott said in a statement to NBC News. “He’s a proven fighter, man of faith and essential part of the Republican Senate Majority.”   Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., has also been publicly backing Cornyn and recently told CNN he was hopeful Trump would back Cornyn in the race.   Asked Wednesday if he has personally asked Trump to endorse Cornyn, Thune told reporters at the Capitol: “Well, we’re having conversations about all of the races on the map. When we have anything to report, we’ll let you know.”  Senate Leadership Fund, the main GOP super PAC involved in Senate races, which is aligned with Republican leadership, indicated it is also in Cornyn's corner. ""Leader John Thune, NRSC Chairman Tim Scott, and many of their colleagues have expressed great admiration and support for Senator John Cornyn and his years of service to the people of Texas,"" SLF Chairman Cory Gardner, a former senator from Colorado, said in a statement to NBC News. ""The Senate Leadership Fund fully intends on seeing him reelected next November."" Mackowiak, a longtime Texas political consultant, told NBC News that he sees Paxton’s early announcement as an indication of two things: The attorney general sees an opening, but he knows he needs time to raise the money required to combat Cornyn and the power of incumbency.   “Paxton’s never run a race this complicated, this expensive against someone as accomplished and serious as John Cornyn,"" he said. ""John Cornyn has never been challenged by someone that has the statewide profile and grassroots enthusiasm Paxton has.""  But Mackowiak argued that while Paxton has sought to go on offense early, that dynamic may not stick, and that the events that led to Paxton’s impeachment trial (which divided Republicans in the state) will likely be relitigated.   “He is going to be playing a lot more defense than he even understands. I think because he got through impeachment, these issues are behind him. They’re not,” he said.   One potential wrinkle, particularly if Hunt or another Republican decides to jump in, is Texas’ runoff rules. If no candidate wins the majority of the vote in the primary, the top two move on to a one-on-one runoff election.   Cornyn has never lost an election in Texas, and he’s never been forced to a runoff by any of his opponents (who have largely challenged him from the right). But the prospect of a split field leading to a runoff is another complicating factor, with both Mackowiak and Steinhauser noting that runoff electorates typically favor the candidate with more grassroots conservative support.  The Texas race could have broader implications for the fight for the Senate next year as Republicans look to defend their slim majority.    Democrats need to net three seats to take control of the Senate, but they face an uphill battle with a short list of targets. Just one Republican — Maine’s Susan Collins — is running in a state that former Vice President Kamala Harris carried in November. Republicans, meanwhile, are looking to grow their majority by targeting Democratic-held seats in battleground states.  But Cornyn said a competitive election in Texas could put a strain on Republicans nationally by diverting money away from other key battlegrounds.   “We’re going to end up spending hundreds of millions of dollars, potentially, on this race in Texas, because we can’t lose the seat in Texas,” said Cornyn, a former NRSC chairman. “And that is money that can’t be used in places like Michigan, New Hampshire and Georgia in the midterm elections.”  Democrats have long coveted the idea of flipping Texas, with former Rep. Beto O’Rourke coming close to defeating Cruz in the blue wave year of 2018. But Trump expanded his margin last year in Texas compared to 2020, carrying Texas by 14 percentage points as Cruz defeated former Democratic Rep. Colin Allred by 9 points.  Allred told The Dallas Morning News last month that he is “seriously considering” another run for Senate against Cornyn. Cruz, meanwhile, told reporters Wednesday that he is staying neutral in this year’s Senate primary, saying both Paxton and Cornyn are friends.   “I have worked closely with both of them. I respect them both,” Cruz said. “And I trust the voters of Texas to make that decision.”  A divisive GOP primary could play into Democrats’ hands — especially if Paxton is the nominee. In the meantime, Democrats are watching the GOP primary process play out in Texas and other states. Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee spokesperson Maeve Coyle noted that former New Hampshire GOP Gov. Chris Sununu announced Tuesday that he would not be running for that state’s open Senate seat.   “As Republicans face a nasty primary in Texas and an embarrassing recruitment failure in New Hampshire — coupled with a building midterm backlash across the map driven by their threats to Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and their push to spike costs for families — Democrats will look for every opportunity to put them on defense,” Coyle said.

780,"Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News  news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time In the wake of President Donald Trump’s announcement Wednesday afternoon that he was pausing country-by-country tariffs by 90 days, some experts — as well as critics of Trump and social media users — are raising questions about a statement he posted earlier in the day that may have indicated the massive sell-off in stocks in recent days was coming to an end.   Not long after trading opened at 9:30 a.m. Wednesday, Trump took to his Truth Social platform and wrote: “BE COOL! Everything is going to work out well. The USA will be bigger and better than ever before!” Four minutes later, he wrote: “THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!! DJT” Just before 1:30 p.m., Trump announced the pause, sending stocks soaring. The tech-heavy Nasdaq index had its biggest one-day gain since 2008, rising nearly 12%, while the S&P 500 climbed 9.5% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 8%, or about 2,800 points.  Trump could have been generally urging people to buy into the market while prices were relatively low. That was the response Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick gave when he was asked about the posts Wednesday evening on CNBC. “Donald Trump understands that … America is the greatest country, all right? We are the greatest country, and we have the capacity for incredible greatness. But someone needs to take the shackles off.” But on social media, some users raised the prospect — without evidence — of market manipulation, while others began referring to the market’s sharp turn upward as the “Trump Pump.”    There is no evidence to suggest that Trump was seeking to manipulate markets or that he or any of his advisers acted on inside information For Richard Painter, chief ethics lawyer for former President George W. Bush, who now teaches government ethics and security regulation at the University of Minnesota’s law school, the morning posts, at a minimum, leave Trump open to questions about his intentions.   “This is a scenario that could expose the president to accusations that he engaged in market manipulation,” Painter said.  Even before he’d been sworn in for his second term, Trump faced insider-trading criticisms amid the launch of his $TRUMP meme coin. In that incident, the Trump Organization was explicit that a group of investors who were helping launch the coin stood to benefit from its release assuming its price went up. Still, reports showed other investors reaping outsized profits from the launch, including one crypto-wallet owner or owners who earned $109 million, according to a New York Times analysis. Some Democrats were quick to blast Trump’s actions on Wednesday. ""An insider trading scandal is brewing,"" Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., posted on X. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., told NBC News that the Trump administration is “replete with grifters” and that “corruption is its middle name.”  “Insider trading is a real threat, and I hope there will be a surge of penetrating investigations into the potential for manipulation and insider trading of securities,” Blumenthal said, “since the knowledge of what Trump’s plans have been and may be is widely spread.” Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif. — a frequent object of Trump’s scorn — also suggested an inquiry was warranted. “Trump is creating giant market fluctuations with his on-again, off-again tariffs,” Schiff wrote on social media. “These constant gyrations in policy provide dangerous opportunities for insider trading. Who in the administration knew about Trump’s latest tariff flip flop ahead of time? Did anyone buy or sell  stocks, and profit at the public’s expense? I’m writing to the White House — the public has a right to know.” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., pointed to the upcoming May 15 deadline for members of Congress to submit their financial disclosure reports, writing on X, ""Any member of Congress who purchased stocks in the last 48 hours should probably disclose that now. I’ve been hearing some interesting chatter on the floor."" A White House spokesman rejected the Democrats’ assertions. “It is the responsibility of the President of the United States to reassure the markets and Americans about their economic security in the face of nonstop media fearmongering,” White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement. “Instead of grasping at straws to try landing a punch on President Trump, Democrats should focus on working with the administration to restore American Greatness.” A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment. The Securities and Exchange Commission did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Painter said the incident could result in investigations “into who knew what and when before [Trump] announced he was going to postpone the tariffs on all the countries except for China.” “This was a terrible idea to make those posts,” Painter said of Trump’s suggestion that it was “a great time to buy.”  Painter further admonished Trump, saying, “I would hope that he would focus on doing his job — and try to calm the markets and have a predictable trade policy and let the markets do their thing without the White House giving what appears to be investment advice.” Rob Wile is a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist covering breaking business stories for NBCNews.com. © 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"
778,"Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News  news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time A bipartisan team of freshman senators who went through some of 2024’s biggest battleground races is introducing a bill Wednesday to give President Donald Trump’s administration the power to stop investments from Chinese companies in the U.S. Sens. Bernie Moreno, R-Ohio; Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich.; and Tim Sheehy, R-Mont., are sponsoring the Providing Rigorous Oversight Through Evaluation of Concerning Transactions Act (or PROTECT Act), which would give the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States new authority to stop both entirely new foreign investment projects in the U.S. and foreign investments in existing facilities. The bill would “require the review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States of greenfield and brownfield investments by foreign countries of concern.” The legislation comes after the White House, in a February memo, asked for Congress to “strengthen” CFIUS’ ability to “restrict foreign adversary access to United States talent and operations in sensitive technologies (especially artificial intelligence).” In an interview, Moreno said Congress needs to give Trump “maximum negotiating leverage” to deal with China, and that this legislation contributes to that goal. ""We all went through extremely expensive, extremely tough races,"" Moreno said of the trio of senators introducing the legislation. ""And I think we’re probably the most in tune with what voters are thinking right now."" In a statement, Slotkin described the need for the legislation in national security terms, pointing to the importance of keeping “sensitive American land” out of Chinese, Iranian or North Korean control. “To address that risk, this bipartisan bill builds on my work in the U.S. House and gives more authority to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. to examine a broader set of transactions,” she said. “That means we can stop land purchases that pose an actual risk to our national security.” The senators introduced the legislation the same day Trump’s 104% total tariff on China went into effect — and he raised it to 125% later Wednesday. Meanwhile, China retaliated with a new 84% tariff on U.S. imports. Moreno promoted Trump’s actions and said the senators’ legislation is part of a broader effort to counter China, describing tariffs as “the beginning.” “You had 50 years where China was allowed into the World Trade Organization, they were given most favored nation trading status, and there was a very naive or corrupt, depending on which individual you’re talking about, view that this would be good for America,” Moreno said. “It has been catastrophically bad. We’ve now created a monster.” Last week, Bloomberg reported that China took steps to restrict Chinese companies from investing in the U.S. following Trump's tariff announcement, according to people familiar with the move. “Unfortunately, there’s a strategic adversary, and we have to reset that relationship in a meaningful way,” he continued, adding, “We don’t want to go to war with China, that’s not the goal here. But we have to stop being suckers, as President Trump talks about.” Trump’s global tariffs went into effect Wednesday, as some administration officials suggest there are deals to be made with trading partners while others have said nothing will change the direction of Trump’s tariff agenda. “Well that’s going to be up to President Trump, certainly,” Moreno said. “You hear from his public statements that he’s willing and open to listen to proposals. But obviously, China is a separate situation where we have over $1 trillion in debt.” Allan Smith is a political reporter for NBC News. © 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"
830,"Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News  news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton’s attempt to topple Republican Sen. John Cornyn in a Senate primary next year kicks off one of the most intense contests of the 2026 elections — a GOP-versus-GOP battle between two men who have been sparring for years and vying for President Donald Trump’s attention.   Cornyn is a fixture of the Republican Party in Texas, serving in its highest offices for more than 30 years and becoming a key voice on Capitol Hill. Paxton, the third-term attorney general who survived a bipartisan impeachment last year in part thanks to support from Trump and conservative activist allies, believes there’s an opening to cut the incumbent down from the right.  Now, both sides are aligning themselves with Trump amid the possibility of an endorsement that could tip the primary.  Whether one comes or not, one thing is clear. “This is gonna be the nastiest race in the modern era of Texas politics, period,” former Travis County GOP chairman Matt Mackowiak said.   Paxton immediately attacked Cornyn for having “turned his back on President Trump,” pointing to comments Cornyn made in 2023 about Trump’s indictment over his handling of classified documents, as well as the senator’s comments that he didn’t think Trump “could win the presidency” after Trump was found liable for sexual abuse in a civil case that same year. Paxton has also targeted Cornyn over his votes on issues including guns and immigration to try to argue that he is more aligned with conservative values. “While John was criticizing Trump and suggesting he shouldn’t run, I was at Mar-a-Lago” for Trump’s presidential announcement speech, Paxton told “The Mark Davis Show” in Dallas.   ""If he had the record of [Texas GOP Sen.] Ted Cruz, would I be here? Absolutely not,"" Paxton continued. ""This isn’t about what he’s saying and the love he suddenly has for President Trump and the love he has for all of our issues now. This isn’t about that love. I don’t believe that love, I believe in action."" Cornyn, though, also made an appeal to Trump’s interests, telling reporters at the Capitol on Wednesday that Paxton’s Senate bid is a “con man’s vanity project.”   “The biggest potential loser is President Trump’s agenda,” Cornyn said of the primary challenge.  “Mr. Paxton has a checkered background, he is a con man and a fraud, and I think the people of Texas know that, but this is what will be litigated during the course of this campaign. I am not going to turn over the Senate seat that was once held by Sam Houston to someone like him,” he added, a reference to the 2023 impeachment trial of Paxton, after which he survived a conviction vote in the state Senate.    “It’s unclear to me exactly what is motivating Mr. Paxton other than vanity and personal ambition,” Cornyn continued.  In the months before Paxton jumped in — and in the hours since — Cornyn has made clear he’s hugging Trump as tight as he can. He posted on X a photo of him reading Trump’s “The Art of the Deal” and called it “recommended” reading; he took to the Senate floor to defend Trump aide and billionaire Elon Musk (whose businesses have a significant footprint in Texas) after protests at Tesla dealerships; and he has been framing himself as one of Trump’s top allies in the Senate.   The roots of this clash between another establishment-insurgent pair of Republicans run deep, part of a decade-plus battle within the Texas GOP that has ousted legislative leaders, fueled Cruz's rise, fanned the flames of Paxton’s impeachment, and led to proxy wars up and down the ballot.   Paxton had been telegraphing a run against Cornyn from the right for more than a year. In early 2024, Paxton lambasted the senator as “anti-Trump [and] anti-gun” in a post on X, adding that “Texans deserve another conservative Senator.”   Cornyn reposted the message and replied: “Hard to run from prison, Ken,” a reference to the investigations that led to the impeachment trial. (The Associated Press reported this month that the Justice Department decided last year not to prosecute Paxton over corruption allegations.)  Brendan Steinhauser, a longtime GOP consultant who served as Cornyn’s campaign manager in the past but is unaffiliated in this race, told NBC News it’s no surprise to see Cornyn campaign with an eye on Trump.   “If you’re Senator Cornyn, you’re going to be campaigning on all the ways that you have supported and worked with the president, you’re going to talk about all the policies where you align, you’re going to talk about helping to get all of his judicial nominees through,” he said.  While a potential endorsement from Trump remains a major question, Cornyn does have support from Senate Republicans. Sen. Tim Scott, of South Carolina, who chairs the National Republican Senatorial Committee, has made his case for Cornyn to White House officials. Scott also told Rep. Wesley Hunt, R-Texas, who has also been weighing a Senate run, that the NRSC is behind Cornyn, according to a source familiar with the discussions.   “John Cornyn is a leader who delivers on President Trump’s agenda and for the people of Texas in the U.S. Senate,” Scott said in a statement to NBC News. “He’s a proven fighter, man of faith and essential part of the Republican Senate Majority.”   Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., has also been publicly backing Cornyn and recently told CNN he was hopeful Trump would back Cornyn in the race.   Asked Wednesday if he has personally asked Trump to endorse Cornyn, Thune told reporters at the Capitol: “Well, we’re having conversations about all of the races on the map. When we have anything to report, we’ll let you know.”  Senate Leadership Fund, the main GOP super PAC involved in Senate races, which is aligned with Republican leadership, indicated it is also in Cornyn's corner. ""Leader John Thune, NRSC Chairman Tim Scott, and many of their colleagues have expressed great admiration and support for Senator John Cornyn and his years of service to the people of Texas,"" SLF Chairman Cory Gardner, a former senator from Colorado, said in a statement to NBC News. ""The Senate Leadership Fund fully intends on seeing him reelected next November."" Mackowiak, a longtime Texas political consultant, told NBC News that he sees Paxton’s early announcement as an indication of two things: The attorney general sees an opening, but he knows he needs time to raise the money required to combat Cornyn and the power of incumbency.   “Paxton’s never run a race this complicated, this expensive against someone as accomplished and serious as John Cornyn,"" he said. ""John Cornyn has never been challenged by someone that has the statewide profile and grassroots enthusiasm Paxton has.""  But Mackowiak argued that while Paxton has sought to go on offense early, that dynamic may not stick, and that the events that led to Paxton’s impeachment trial (which divided Republicans in the state) will likely be relitigated.   “He is going to be playing a lot more defense than he even understands. I think because he got through impeachment, these issues are behind him. They’re not,” he said.   One potential wrinkle, particularly if Hunt or another Republican decides to jump in, is Texas’ runoff rules. If no candidate wins the majority of the vote in the primary, the top two move on to a one-on-one runoff election.   Cornyn has never lost an election in Texas, and he’s never been forced to a runoff by any of his opponents (who have largely challenged him from the right). But the prospect of a split field leading to a runoff is another complicating factor, with both Mackowiak and Steinhauser noting that runoff electorates typically favor the candidate with more grassroots conservative support.  The Texas race could have broader implications for the fight for the Senate next year as Republicans look to defend their slim majority.    Democrats need to net three seats to take control of the Senate, but they face an uphill battle with a short list of targets. Just one Republican — Maine’s Susan Collins — is running in a state that former Vice President Kamala Harris carried in November. Republicans, meanwhile, are looking to grow their majority by targeting Democratic-held seats in battleground states.  But Cornyn said a competitive election in Texas could put a strain on Republicans nationally by diverting money away from other key battlegrounds.   “We’re going to end up spending hundreds of millions of dollars, potentially, on this race in Texas, because we can’t lose the seat in Texas,” said Cornyn, a former NRSC chairman. “And that is money that can’t be used in places like Michigan, New Hampshire and Georgia in the midterm elections.”  Democrats have long coveted the idea of flipping Texas, with former Rep. Beto O’Rourke coming close to defeating Cruz in the blue wave year of 2018. But Trump expanded his margin last year in Texas compared to 2020, carrying Texas by 14 percentage points as Cruz defeated former Democratic Rep. Colin Allred by 9 points.  Allred told The Dallas Morning News last month that he is “seriously considering” another run for Senate against Cornyn. Cruz, meanwhile, told reporters Wednesday that he is staying neutral in this year’s Senate primary, saying both Paxton and Cornyn are friends.   “I have worked closely with both of them. I respect them both,” Cruz said. “And I trust the voters of Texas to make that decision.”  A divisive GOP primary could play into Democrats’ hands — especially if Paxton is the nominee. In the meantime, Democrats are watching the GOP primary process play out in Texas and other states. Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee spokesperson Maeve Coyle noted that former New Hampshire GOP Gov. Chris Sununu announced Tuesday that he would not be running for that state’s open Senate seat.   “As Republicans face a nasty primary in Texas and an embarrassing recruitment failure in New Hampshire — coupled with a building midterm backlash across the map driven by their threats to Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and their push to spike costs for families — Democrats will look for every opportunity to put them on defense,” Coyle said.

832,"Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News  news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time In the wake of President Donald Trump’s announcement Wednesday afternoon that he was pausing country-by-country tariffs by 90 days, some experts — as well as critics of Trump and social media users — are raising questions about a statement he posted earlier in the day that may have indicated the massive sell-off in stocks in recent days was coming to an end.   Not long after trading opened at 9:30 a.m. Wednesday, Trump took to his Truth Social platform and wrote: “BE COOL! Everything is going to work out well. The USA will be bigger and better than ever before!” Four minutes later, he wrote: “THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!! DJT” Just before 1:30 p.m., Trump announced the pause, sending stocks soaring. The tech-heavy Nasdaq index had its biggest one-day gain since 2008, rising nearly 12%, while the S&P 500 climbed 9.5% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 8%, or about 2,800 points.  Trump could have been generally urging people to buy into the market while prices were relatively low. That was the response Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick gave when he was asked about the posts Wednesday evening on CNBC. “Donald Trump understands that … America is the greatest country, all right? We are the greatest country, and we have the capacity for incredible greatness. But someone needs to take the shackles off.” But on social media, some users raised the prospect — without evidence — of market manipulation, while others began referring to the market’s sharp turn upward as the “Trump Pump.”    There is no evidence to suggest that Trump was seeking to manipulate markets or that he or any of his advisers acted on inside information For Richard Painter, chief ethics lawyer for former President George W. Bush, who now teaches government ethics and security regulation at the University of Minnesota’s law school, the morning posts, at a minimum, leave Trump open to questions about his intentions.   “This is a scenario that could expose the president to accusations that he engaged in market manipulation,” Painter said.  Even before he’d been sworn in for his second term, Trump faced insider-trading criticisms amid the launch of his $TRUMP meme coin. In that incident, the Trump Organization was explicit that a group of investors who were helping launch the coin stood to benefit from its release assuming its price went up. Still, reports showed other investors reaping outsized profits from the launch, including one crypto-wallet owner or owners who earned $109 million, according to a New York Times analysis. Some Democrats were quick to blast Trump’s actions on Wednesday. ""An insider trading scandal is brewing,"" Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., posted on X. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., told NBC News that the Trump administration is “replete with grifters” and that “corruption is its middle name.”  “Insider trading is a real threat, and I hope there will be a surge of penetrating investigations into the potential for manipulation and insider trading of securities,” Blumenthal said, “since the knowledge of what Trump’s plans have been and may be is widely spread.” Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif. — a frequent object of Trump’s scorn — also suggested an inquiry was warranted. “Trump is creating giant market fluctuations with his on-again, off-again tariffs,” Schiff wrote on social media. “These constant gyrations in policy provide dangerous opportunities for insider trading. Who in the administration knew about Trump’s latest tariff flip flop ahead of time? Did anyone buy or sell  stocks, and profit at the public’s expense? I’m writing to the White House — the public has a right to know.” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., pointed to the upcoming May 15 deadline for members of Congress to submit their financial disclosure reports, writing on X, ""Any member of Congress who purchased stocks in the last 48 hours should probably disclose that now. I’ve been hearing some interesting chatter on the floor."" A White House spokesman rejected the Democrats’ assertions. “It is the responsibility of the President of the United States to reassure the markets and Americans about their economic security in the face of nonstop media fearmongering,” White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement. “Instead of grasping at straws to try landing a punch on President Trump, Democrats should focus on working with the administration to restore American Greatness.” A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment. The Securities and Exchange Commission did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Painter said the incident could result in investigations “into who knew what and when before [Trump] announced he was going to postpone the tariffs on all the countries except for China.” “This was a terrible idea to make those posts,” Painter said of Trump’s suggestion that it was “a great time to buy.”  Painter further admonished Trump, saying, “I would hope that he would focus on doing his job — and try to calm the markets and have a predictable trade policy and let the markets do their thing without the White House giving what appears to be investment advice.” Rob Wile is a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist covering breaking business stories for NBCNews.com. © 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"
1088,"Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News  news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time As President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariff plans sent stocks tumbling and economists warning of a broader economic slowdown, many of Trump’s supporters say they support the move as part of a broader vision for the U.S. economy, even if prices rise. But a slice of 2024 Trump voters are deeply concerned, illustrating the real potential political peril for the president and his party. In interviews, 20 swing-state Trump voters who participated in last month’s national NBC News poll spoke about Trump and his tariffs after the president's policy announcement last week. Most are either fully on board with Trump’s vision — with many explicitly saying they are willing to live through short-term economic pain if it means achieving his vision of reordering the global economy to America’s benefit — or are cautiously optimistic that the tariffs will be effective negotiating tools. Veronica Rogers, a retiree in Georgia, was among those who said that Trump’s long-term goals of bringing back jobs to the United States outweigh her concerns about temporary higher prices. “Whether that’d be short term, or that’d be long term, I don’t know. I’m not an economist. But I do know that there’s billions and trillions of dollars that can be spent here to build industry to keep from paying tariffs. So, that sounds good to me,” she said. She was stunned that some people were taken aback by the scale of Trump’s tariffs, noting how frequently he talked about tariffs while campaigning. “Nothing they’re doing is news to people that voted for him,” Rogers, 63, said. Still, a handful of voters, including those who backed Trump in 2020 and 2024, warned that his tariff rollout threatens to squander one of his major campaign promises: to lower prices for Americans in the long term. The NBC News poll conducted in March, before Trump fully unveiled his tariff plans, found that a majority of Americans (55%) disapproved of his handling of inflation and the cost of living, while 54% disapproved of his handling of the economy overall. Members of the GOP were far more likely to give Trump passing marks on the economy than were independents and Democrats, but about 1 in 10 Republicans expressed displeasure with his handling of the key issues. “The track he’s on right now is just to piss the Democrats off, and I think it’s kind of working, but no, I’m not really too happy with the way things are going right now. He’s really gone off the wall,” said Cathy Phillips, a 64-year-old Pennsylvanian who voted for Trump in 2020 and 2024. “We’re scraping pennies together, I know how hard it is for us,” she continued. “I can’t imagine how hard it is for seniors who are even older than us. Something’s gotta give somewhere.” Yet, for many of these voters, Trump’s decision to put heavy tariffs on some of America’s biggest trading partners, such as the European Union, China and Vietnam, as well as most other countries, is exactly what they signed up for. “I feel like everything that I voted for has come to fruition already and more,” said Melanie Renaud, a 52-year-old dental hygienist from North Carolina. Some point to local factories that shuttered and moved jobs overseas, leaving behind crumbling communities, to argue for drastic steps to bring jobs back to the U.S. Others believe some of the sky-high tariff rates are a hard-edged negotiating tactic aimed at compelling countries to make immediate concessions that will help the American economy in the long term. Others said it’s a needed response to an economy they believe wasn’t working for them. “This trade war has to happen in order for fair trade to happen. And once fair trade is accomplished, I think prices will even back out,” said Reece Westfall, a 30-year-old Pennsylvania Republican.  “There’s a lot more to this than the price of everything,” Westfall continued, echoing recent arguments from Trump administration officials, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on NBC News’ “Meet the Press.” Donna J., 55, who declined to give her last name, said that while her part of North Carolina had a long history of textile mills like the one in which her grandfather worked, the town “basically folded in upon itself” once that factory closed. “What you get used to, sometimes, is the very thing that will kill you,” she said of how the globalized economy has hurt communities like hers. She said Americans need to “learn some patience and understand this is for the betterment of everyone,” calling the tariffs an example of Trump’s “promises made, promises kept.” But other voters who backed Trump were critical of the president’s approach. David, a Wisconsin man who voted for Trump in 2020 and 2024, said the administration is “throwing spaghetti at the wall to see what sticks.” (Like some others who were critical of Trump, he declined to share his last name because of concerns about retribution or harassment.) “I cannot see a reasonable businessperson in the near term looking at this and saying, ‘I feel confident that I can invest millions of dollars into a new production facility and create new jobs in the U.S.,” he said, later adding, “I was expecting a more reasoned and logical rollout.” David said he voted for Trump because of the economy, believing a continuation of Biden administration policies if Kamala Harris had won the election would not have been good for the country. But despite his hesitance about Trump’s economic policies, David said he would still vote for him if given a chance for a do-over, even if it was less than a full-throated support. “I would like to think that there would be a better option in the future,” he added. Another Trump voter, who declined to give his first or last name because of concerns about harassment or retaliation, said he now sees his vote for Trump as a “big mistake.” The 64-year-old Arizona man said his retirement savings have fallen 35% in recent weeks, and he may now have to delay his retirement. “It’s happened without any reasonable explanation,” he said “I don’t understand. I don’t understand how to declare a trade war on the world, how to betray the allies, I can’t understand it.” Many of the Trump voters who spoke to NBC News said they didn’t believe the high tariffs would last, instead predicting that they would compel other countries to the negotiating table. “I wouldn’t be surprised if, in the next month or two, we see a lot of these countries do bilateral negotiations,” said John, a 30-year-old from Arizona who voted for Trump in 2016 and 2024 but supported Joe Biden in 2020. “Part of these extremely high tariffs are designed, in a sense, in my belief, as a way to get more from these countries,” he continued. Ultimately, some of Trump’s most ardent supporters said they would be personally willing to take their lumps now, both in terms of potential rising prices and an unstable stock market, if it meant that the president's plans to reorient the global economy succeed, because they believe it will leave a better future for their children. “I’m willing to not look at my [401k] numbers on a daily basis. I’m willing to trust President Trump that it will turn around,” said Jodi L., a 62-year-old from Michigan. “I have to do my part. I can call up and complain all I want, but I believe it’s on the right path to turning this country around. I believe in him and what he’s said he would do because he’s proven himself in less than 100 days.” “I’m willing to take the knock if that’s what it takes for the long term.” Sherry Behr, a 67-year-old Republican from Pennsylvania, said, “I trust President Trump, that in six months, a year, we’ll start seeing a difference.”  Most Trump voters said they could not envision a scenario that would cause them to pull their support for him. But a few noted there might be a financial breaking point depending on how high prices go, and for how long. “If it goes like $100 for a pair of shoes, for stupid shoes, then we’re gonna have issues then,” said Nyssa, a 33-year-old stay-at-home mom in Pennsylvania, who said she backed Trump in hopes he would bring down grocery prices. “But a couple bucks here and there is not gonna really hurt anything.” And for a smaller few, the tariff debate has demonstrated that Trump isn’t following through on a key promise, either because of a perceived lack of attention or push to prioritize vengeance over solutions. David, the Wisconsin man, noted that Trump specifically criticized the Biden administration on high prices during the 2024 campaign. “And then shortly after coming into office, all sudden the tune changes, and it’s like, ‘Well, we’re going to see some prices go up,’” he said. Chelsea Linares, a 33-year-old insurance account manager in Georgia, told NBC News that Trump’s work on the economy has been a “slower start that I would say myself, and others, have anticipated,” noting prices are still high. While she’s still “optimistic,” she thinks “it’s going to get worse before it gets better.” “Even people that support Trump are probably going to be more pissed than they thought,” she said, adding that she still supported him. Blake, a three-time Trump voter from Arizona who is in his 30s, described himself as someone in “full ideological agreement” with the president on many issues. He said he would have scored Trump a 10/10 for his administration’s efforts in its first few days on issues including immigration and ending diversity, equity and inclusion programs. But he panned the tariff rollout as “lazy,” adding that the push could squander the full control of Washington that voters gave Republicans after the 2024 election. “I could be wrong, but I feel the cannonball way they came out with this is maximizing the pain without necessarily optimizing the speed we recover from it,” he said.

1087,"Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News  news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time President Donald Trump and his billionaire adviser Elon Musk have fanned the flames of a baseless rumor about America’s gold reserves at least a dozen times since mid-February.  The conspiracy theory, alleging without evidence that someone might have stolen the gold reserves from Fort Knox, Kentucky, has circulated for decades, but it seems to have first appeared on the Trump administration’s radar after far-right financial blog Zero Hedge tagged Musk in a post about the idea on X.   Since then, Musk and Trump have shared the idea and teased plans for a personal inspection of the fortress that holds the government’s gold bars.  Despite raising alarm and fueling conspiracy chatter online and offline, there is no evidence that any gold is missing, and there’s no indication that Musk or Trump has taken any concrete steps toward visiting Fort Knox. A White House spokesperson declined to comment on their plans, saying in an email: “No announcements at this time.”   The rumor immediately found an audience, including gold obsessives who have nurtured conspiracy theories about government gold reserves for more than 50 years. Many of them stubbornly reject the evidence that Fort Knox is secure, and they interpret its security measures as evidence that the government is hiding something.  Aaron Klein, the chair of economic studies at the Brookings Institution, said the statements by Musk and Trump fit a pattern of the two men trying to sow doubt in traditional institutions.   “The gold has come to have a symbolic value of the faith in the U.S. government’s fundamental position,” said Klein, who served in the Obama Treasury Department.  “Questioning the gold as having been ‘lost’ or ‘stolen’ is part of a series of actions that undermine confidence in America,” he added. “Why somebody who purports to be trying to restore America would want to undermine its confidence is confusing.”  Trump and Musk are tapping into a classic but obscure rumor with a long history: People have recycled the claim that Fort Knox is empty on a semiregular basis, sometimes paired with vague anti-government vibes.   “It comes up periodically, and it has for decades,” said Philip Diehl, a former director of the U.S. Mint, which oversees the gold storage. “Eventually, the pressure builds, and the president sends somebody in to take a look.”  In 1974, after a gadfly author named Peter Beter charged that unnamed powerful interests had looted Fort Knox, the rumor spread so widely that the U.S. Mint decided to invite lawmakers and journalists for a tour. And in 2011, then-Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, who favored abolishing the Federal Reserve and returning to a gold-based currency system, held a congressional hearing on whether the Fort Knox gold was secure. Treasury officials from both Republican and Democratic administrations have repeatedly said the gold is fine, and in 2017, Trump’s treasury secretary at the time, Steven Mnuchin, visited the Kentucky fortress and came away satisfied.   “The gold was there when I visited it. I hope nobody’s moved it. I’m sure they haven’t,” Mnuchin, who isn’t serving in Trump’s second administration, told CNBC in February.  Trump’s current treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, told podcast host Dan O’Donnell in February: “All the gold is present and accounted for.”   No visit has materialized in the nearly two months since then, and it’s not clear why. Paul, the former congressman, said he’s not sure Musk and Trump will follow through. He has criticized Trump at times, including for bombing Yemen last month.   “They have other things to deal with. They have to plan the bombing in Yemen, and they have to deal with the oil in Syria. They have to stop a war on Ukraine, and so the gold they can forget about for a while. They’ll avoid it if they see an advantage to it. So that is why people don’t trust governments,” he said.  Paul said he believes past audits haven’t been thorough enough. He wants Trump and Musk to perform lab tests known as assays to determine the exact composition of the gold bars.  The gold reserve used to have a practical purpose: to allow foreign governments to swap their dollars for gold. But President Richard Nixon ended the practice in 1971. Now, its value is mainly symbolic of U.S. wealth, and other countries, such as China, have recently sought to build up their own reserves.  The gold theft rumors have come in several varieties, all without evidence, among them that European bankers took the gold or that the Rockefeller banking family did.  Certain conspiracy theories tend to pop up repeatedly over time, said Bret Schafer, a senior fellow who studies disinformation at the German Marshall Fund, a nonprofit organization that works to strengthen the U.S.-Europe alliance. Allegedly government-made bioweapons are one such recurring conspiracy theory, he said, and the Fort Knox gold rumor is another.   “These rumors work best when they’re built up over time. It’s like Hollywood sequels: You build off the original,” he said. And in both cases, he added, “you just get a lot of retreads.”  Fort Knox has appeared in movies that add to its allure. A scheme involving the facility is a major plot point in the 1964 James Bond film “Goldfinger,” underscoring the belief that Fort Knox could be a tempting target.   And unlike some internet-era hoaxes, the Fort Knox rumors originated in an age when conspiracy theories spread by less efficient means, not on X, whose owner, Musk, has 218 million listed followers.  “It precedes the social media digital age, but now we’re in an environment where things can pop from the corners of ‘conspiracy land’ to policy action in a matter of hours, because all of you have to do is land on Musk’s radar,” Schafer said.  Formally known as the U.S. Bullion Depository, the gold reserve site is next to the Army base Fort Knox. It was built in 1936, and President Franklin Roosevelt was the only visitor until the tour for media and members of Congress in 1974.  The tour 51 years ago yielded newspaper headlines such as one in The New York Times: “Visitors Get a Peek at Fort Knox Gold—It’s There.”  The Treasury Department’s nonpartisan inspector general audits the gold every year, said Eric Thorson, a former inspector general who’s now retired. He said that he sent teams of about three people every year and that he went personally once in 2011.   “There is absolutely zero doubt the gold is there,” he said.  “I’m a former Air Force pilot. I’ve been on bases with nuclear weapons, and this place has every bit the security that any nuclear base has,” he added. “The security is unbelievable. Nobody’s going to go in there and take it.”  Zero Hedge, a far-right financial blog and social media brand that appears to have first alerted Musk to the idea, frequently posts about gold as an investment. It tweeted in 2011 about Paul’s Fort Knox concerns and in 2017 about Mnuchin’s Fort Knox visit. Sometimes, accounts on X respond to Zero Hedge posts with commentary about Fort Knox.  Then, on Feb. 15, Zero Hedge posted a suggestion on X and tagged Musk directly.  “It would be great if @elonmusk could take a look inside Fort Knox just to make sure the 4,580 tons of US gold is there. Last time anyone looked was 50 years ago in 1974,” the account posted.  The second sentence is wrong, according to Thorson, but the post got the attention of Musk and others. It had 3.3 million views as of Friday.   “Surely it’s reviewed at least every year?” Musk responded to the post. Zero Hedge replied, repeating the falsehood that the gold isn’t reviewed every year.  Google Trends data shows that after the interaction, web searches for the term “Fort Knox” hit their highest level since Google began collecting data in 2004 and kept rising for several days.   On Feb. 16, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., Ron Paul’s son, chimed in. He repeated the inaccuracy that the gold isn’t reviewed annually and said, “Let’s do it.”  Zero Hedge has often faced restrictions on tech platforms for violating terms of service, including publishing allegedly derogatory material. In 2022, U.S. intelligence officials accused the site of amplifying Russian propaganda, a claim it denied. But under Musk’s ownership of X, Zero Hedge has thrived, growing its follower count from 1.5 million to 2.1 million.  Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones also discussed the Fort Knox rumor on his podcast. He said he supported Musk’s looking into Fort Knox while acknowledging that he heard the same rumor as a child more than 40 years ago. Jones’ sponsors and advertisers have for years included gold retailers.   Soon, Musk and Trump were fueling the uncertainty. On Feb. 17, Musk posted on X about the gold: “Maybe it’s there, maybe it’s not.” He spoke about it on Joe Rogan’s podcast and at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference, often mixing the conspiracy theory with attempts at humor.   “We want to go see it and just make sure somebody didn’t spray-paint some lead or something, you know?” Musk said at CPAC on Feb. 20.  Musk reiterated his intention to inspect the goal as recently as March 30 at a town hall-style event in Wisconsin, after an unidentified audience member raised the subject. “You were going to go check our gold, and I’m worried about the Democrats and Joe Biden’s last administration with the money not being there,” the audience member said.  “Did you get blocked? Or are you still able to check that?” he asked.  “That’s up to the president, of course, but I think it would be awesome to livestream Fort Knox,” Musk responded. “Hopefully it looks really cool.”  Trump mentioned it to reporters several times, including in the Oval Office on Feb. 24. He has a longtime fascination with gold, with a golden escalator at one of his New York towers and a chocolate bar wrapped in gold foil for sale on his website for $86.  “We’re actually going to Fort Knox to see if the gold is there, because maybe somebody stole the gold, tons of gold,” Trump said, without citing any evidence. The gold facility doesn’t offer tours, and its website is blunt: “No visitors are permitted in the facility.” But the Treasury Department answers to the president and would presumably let him in. The department didn’t respond to requests for comment.  The U.S. Mint says Fort Knox holds about 147.3 million ounces of gold currently, or about half the Treasury’s total gold reserves. That’s worth about $450 billion at the current market price — which is both a massive fortune and not enough to cover what the federal government spends in a single month.   Diehl, who was director of the U.S. Mint in the 1990s, said there’s a lot of overlap between Trump’s voting base and people who invest in metals such as gold or commemorative coins.  “Talking about gold speaks directly to his base,” said Diehl, who’s now the president of U.S. Money Reserve, a gold retailer.  Diehl said he’s certain the Fort Knox gold is secure, and yet he said he anticipates a surprise announcement of some kind by Trump, just given his approaching to governing: maybe selling the gold, maybe buying more, maybe something else entirely.  The price of gold soared to record highs in recent days amid concerns about Trump’s trade wars before they fell again along with other asset prices since last week’s tariff announcement. It’s unclear whether Musk or Trump has any personal gold holdings.  Thorson, the retired Treasury Department inspector general, said he believes the Fort Knox rumors are politically useful for Trump and Musk.  “What is probably happening here is taking any chance to make the American public feel that they’re being taken advantage of and that they’re a victim,” he said. Now, he said, Trump and Musk can position themselves as saviors in the mold of Trump’s 2016 statement “I alone can fix it.”   And the longer the visit doesn’t happen, the more useful the rumors become for anyone who benefits from them.  “If the intent is to undermine the financial system, you don’t actually want anyone to go there and look,” said Schafer, of the German Marshall Fund.  David Ingram is a tech reporter for NBC News. © 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

In today’s edition, we dive into President Donald Trump’s sudden decision to pause many of his new tariffs. Plus, we explain why Texas is set to host one of the most intense contests of the 2026 midterms. And Andrea Mitchell previews the upcoming nuclear talks between the United States and Iran.  Sign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here. — Adam Wollner One week after his “Liberation Day,” President Donald Trump said he was pausing higher targeted tariffs for most countries for 90 days, a stunning reversal in his trade war that sent markets reeling.  In a social media post just before 1:30 p.m., Trump wrote that he came to the decision because more than 75 trading partners did not retaliate and have reached out to the United States to “discuss” some of the issues he had raised.   But the pause didn’t apply to China, which has retaliated with 84% hikes. Trump instead raised duties for it to 125%, effective immediately.    Zooming out: The trade war isn’t exactly over, and the pause didn’t return the world to the time before Trump touched off the global instability. A 10% across-the-board duty will remain — including for some products from Canada and Mexico.  The White House wouldn’t say which countries would be covered by the pause. Earlier Wednesday the European Union voted to impose fresh retaliatory duties, but they aren’t set to take effect until next week.  And separate tariffs on imported autos, steel and aluminum will remain, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said later — while planned tariffs on items like lumber and pharmaceuticals are still on.  How Wall Street responded: Markets soared on the surprising news Wednesday, with the S&P 500 climbing more than 9%, the tech-heavy Nasdaq closing up more than 12% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average ending nearly 3,000 points higher.   Goldman Sachs lowered its odds of a recession but said it is still forecasting minimal economic growth and a 45% probability of a recession given the remaining tariffs in place. What Trump said: Trump appeared to dig in on his tariff plan just hours earlier, telling Americans “BE COOL” on Truth Social. And he suggested not that long ago that the tariffs could be permanent.   “I thought that people were jumping a little bit out of line. They were getting yippie, you know, they were getting a little bit yippie, a little bit afraid,” he told reporters at the White House. “So we’ll see how it all works out. I think it’s going to work out amazing,” he added. Read more →  Related reads: Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton’s attempt to topple Republican Sen.

Leading the talks for Iran: Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, a veteran of nuclear negotiations. But so far, the two sides can’t even agree on the nature of the talks.  President Donald Trump told reporters they would be holding direct talks, which Iran has rejected since Trump withdrew in 2018 from the multinational Iran nuclear deal President Barack Obama’s secretary of state, John Kerry, negotiated three years earlier. Araghchi says they’ve agreed only to hold indirect talks, exchanging proposals through diplomatic go-betweens as they’d done with the Biden administration for two years, which went nowhere.  The stakes are serious: Iran has been processing nuclear fuel so rapidly it now has the ability to create one bomb within a week or two, according to the United Nations, former Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Trump administration warnings — though it would still take an estimated year or longer for Tehran to be able to create a warhead small enough for one of its ballistic missiles to carry.  Why are the talks so critical? Trump warned Monday that “it’s getting to be very dangerous territory, and hopefully those talks will be successful. And I think it would be in Iran’s best interests if they are successful.” Last month, he was more explicit, telling “Meet the Press” moderator Kristen Welker, “If they don’t make a deal, there will be bombing, and it will be bombing the likes of which they have never seen before.”  Multiple U.S. officials told NBC News that Iran is vulnerable to an attack: Israel’s retaliatory strike against Iran last fall eliminated many of Tehran’s air defenses. Israel has also killed the leader of Hezbollah, Iran’s proxy and front line of defense in neighboring Lebanon. Hamas’ leaders in Gaza, also Iran’s proxies, are gone. So is Tehran’s powerful ally in Syria, Bashar al-Assad. Trump has repeatedly signaled that he doesn’t want a war with Iran. To avoid one, the two sides have to at least agree, finally, to come face to face. That’s all From the Politics Desk for now. Today’s newsletter was compiled by Adam Wollner.

1092,"Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News  news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time WASHINGTON — “Liberation Day” just gave way to Capitulation Day. President Donald Trump pulled back Wednesday on a series of harsh tariffs targeting friends and foes alike in an audacious bid to remake the global economic order.  Trump's early afternoon announcement followed a harrowing week in which Republican lawmakers and confidants privately warned him that the tariffs could wreck the economy. His own aides had quietly raised alarms about the financial markets before he suspended a tariff regime that he had unveiled with a flourish just one week earlier in a Rose Garden ceremony. Follow live politics coverage here The stock market rose immediately after the about-face, ending days of losses that have forced older Americans who've been sinking their savings into 401(k)s to rethink their retirement plans. Ahead of Trump's announcement, some of his advisers had been in a near panic about the bond markets, according to a senior administration official. Interest rates on 10-year Treasury bonds had been rising, contrary to what normally happens when stock prices fall and investors seek safety in treasuries. The unusual dynamic meant that at the same time the tariffs could push up prices, people would be paying more to buy homes or pay off credit card debt because of higher interest rates. Businesses looking to expand would pay more for new loans. Two of Trump's most senior advisers, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, presented a united front Wednesday, urging him to suspend the tariffs in light of the bond market, the administration official said. In a social media post, Trump announced a 90-day pause that he said he’ll use to negotiate deals with dozens of countries that have expressed openness to revising trade terms that he contends exploit American businesses and workers. One exception is China. Trump upped the tariff on the country’s biggest geopolitical rival to 125%, part of a tit-for-tat escalation in an evolving trade war. Trump reversed course one week after he appeared in the Rose Garden and unveiled his plan to bring jobs back to the United States. Displaying a chart showing the new, elevated tariffs that countries would face, Trump proclaimed, “My fellow Americans, this is Liberation Day.” It proved short-lived. Markets plunged in anticipation of heightened trade wars, wiping out trillions of dollars in wealth. Democrats seized on the issue, looking to undercut a source of Trump’s popular appeal: the view that he can be trusted to steer the nation’s economy.  “Donald Trump’s market crash has vaporized a whopping $104,000 from the average retirement account,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Wednesday on the Senate floor, hours before Trump’s reversal. The episode laid bare the rifts within Trump’s team of senior advisers as the White House struggled to offer a clear, consistent argument about the duration of the tariffs. While Bessent seemed open to negotiations, Peter Navarro, a senior trade adviser, appeared to take a more hard-line posture.  Elon Musk, the billionaire Tesla CEO who has been advising Trump on the government workforce, called Navarro “dumber than a sack of bricks,” while Navarro described Musk as someone who is merely “a car assembler, in many cases.” But the weeklong drama also underscored the peril of a policymaking process that is often tied to the wishes and vagaries of one man: Trump. Asked about the dust-up between Musk and Navarro, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a golf partner of Trump’s, said: “I don’t think it matters. The only one who matters is Trump.” Markets tend to favor predictability, as do business leaders deciding where to build new plants. When Trump sets a course, however, there are bound to be detours. A friend of his who spoke to him in recent days said Trump gave no sign he was about to “back down quickly on this stuff.” Trump believes other countries trade unfairly and sees tariffs as a tool to make the United States more competitive, the person said. “He’s very confident it’s going to work for him,” the person added, speaking on condition of anonymity. And yet in the run-up to Wednesday’s announcement, Trump and his aides were also hearing from GOP lawmakers and outside allies urging an alternative path. One was Larry Kudlow, who hosts a show on Fox Business Network and was a senior economic adviser in Trump’s first term. Kudlow told NBC News that he has had “ongoing” talks with friends in the West Wing about the need to negotiate with other countries before the United States slaps them with tariffs that stand in perpetuity. Describing Trump’s move Wednesday as “fabulous,” Kudlow added: “Dealmaking is the best thing to do. In the last 48 hours, Trump has gone from non-negotiating to negotiating. It’s very clear that Bessent is now the point man on trade. Very clear.” Anxious GOP lawmakers also weighed in. Graham said he spoke to Trump at length Tuesday night and told him he has been hearing from car manufacturers who are worried about how the tariffs would affect their business. BMW operates a plant in Graham’s home state and is one of the companies he said he has spoken to. Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., a lawmaker who was also in touch with the administration, said Tuesday that he planned to have lunch with Bessent. On Wednesday, he told NBC News he was also talking to the White House. Kennedy likened Trump to the “pit bull who caught the car.” Now, he said, the question becomes: “What are you going to do with the car?” After more market losses this week, and with pressure mounting from Republicans on Capitol Hill, Trump began having second thoughts. In his first term, he often viewed the ups and downs of the stock market as a kind of report card on his presidency, celebrating its rise. The downturn had gotten his attention. “People were getting a little queasy,” he acknowledged Wednesday at an event with NASCAR racing champions. ""Over the last few days,"" he began to more seriously consider pausing the additional tariffs, he told reporters later in the day in an Oval Office appearance. One prospect that intrigued him was personally negotiating new trade deals with the countries looking to get out from under the tariffs, the senior administration official said. He'd made up his mind. Sitting with Bessent and Lutnick, he crafted the note announcing the 90-day postponement and ending, for the time being, the biggest economic crisis of his young presidency. “We wrote it from our hearts, right?” Trump said. “It was written as something that I think was very positive for the world and for us, and we don’t want to hurt countries that don’t need to be hurt, and they all want to negotiate.” The day closed with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up nearly 8%, erasing some — but not all — of the post-“Liberation Day” losses. Messy as it all may have seemed, his administration insisted that all is unfolding as planned. ""You have been watching the greatest economic master strategy from an American President in history,"" White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller posted Wednesday afternoon.

156,"Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton’s attempt to topple Republican Sen. John Cornyn in a Senate primary next year kicks off one of the most intense contests of the 2026 elections — a GOP-versus-GOP battle between two men who have been sparring for years and vying for President Donald Trump’s attention.

Cornyn is a fixture of the Republican Party in Texas, serving in its highest offices for more than 30 years and becoming a key voice on Capitol Hill. Paxton, the third-term attorney general who survived a bipartisan impeachment last year in part thanks to support from Trump and conservative activist allies, believes there’s an opening to cut the incumbent down from the right.

Now, both sides are aligning themselves with Trump amid the possibility of an endorsement that could tip the primary.

Whether one comes or not, one thing is clear. “This is gonna be the nastiest race in the modern era of Texas politics, period,” former Travis County GOP chairman Matt Mackowiak said.

Paxton immediately attacked Cornyn for having “turned his back on President Trump,” pointing to comments Cornyn made in 2023 about Trump’s indictment over his handling of classified documents, as well as the senator’s comments that he didn’t think Trump “could win the presidency” after Trump was found liable for sexual abuse in a civil case that same year.

Paxton has also targeted Cornyn over his votes on issues including guns and immigration to try to argue that he is more aligned with conservative values.

“While John was criticizing Trump and suggesting he shouldn’t run, I was at Mar-a-Lago” for Trump’s presidential announcement speech, Paxton told “The Mark Davis Show” in Dallas.

""If he had the record of [Texas GOP Sen.] Ted Cruz, would I be here? Absolutely not,"" Paxton continued. ""This isn’t about what he’s saying and the love he suddenly has for President Trump and the love he has for all of our issues now. This isn’t about that love. I don’t believe that love, I believe in action.""

Cornyn, though, also made an appeal to Trump’s interests, telling reporters at the Capitol on Wednesday that Paxton’s Senate bid is a “con man’s vanity project.”

“The biggest potential loser is President Trump’s agenda,” Cornyn said of the primary challenge.

“Mr. Paxton has a checkered background, he is a con man and a fraud, and I think the people of Texas know that, but this is what will be litigated during the course of this campaign. I am not going to turn over the Senate seat that was once held by Sam Houston to someone like him,” he added, a reference to the 2023 impeachment trial of Paxton, after which he survived a conviction vote in the state Senate.

“It’s unclear to me exactly what is motivating Mr. Paxton other than vanity and personal ambition,” Cornyn continued.

In the months before Paxton jumped in — and in the hours since — Cornyn has made clear he’s hugging Trump as tight as he can. He posted on X a photo of him reading Trump’s “The Art of the Deal” and called it “recommended” reading; he took to the Senate floor to defend Trump aide and billionaire Elon Musk (whose businesses have a significant footprint in Texas) after protests at Tesla dealerships; and he has been framing himself as one of Trump’s top allies in the Senate.

A long-simmering feud

The roots of this clash between another establishment-insurgent pair of Republicans run deep, part of a decade-plus battle within the Texas GOP that has ousted legislative leaders, fueled Cruz's rise, fanned the flames of Paxton’s impeachment, and led to proxy wars up and down the ballot.

Paxton had been telegraphing a run against Cornyn from the right for more than a year. In early 2024, Paxton lambasted the senator as “anti-Trump [and] anti-gun” in a post on X, adding that “Texans deserve another conservative Senator.”

Cornyn reposted the message and replied: “Hard to run from prison, Ken,” a reference to the investigations that led to the impeachment trial. (The Associated Press reported this month that the Justice Department decided last year not to prosecute Paxton over corruption allegations.)

Brendan Steinhauser, a longtime GOP consultant who served as Cornyn’s campaign manager in the past but is unaffiliated in this race, told NBC News it’s no surprise to see Cornyn campaign with an eye on Trump.

“If you’re Senator Cornyn, you’re going to be campaigning on all the ways that you have supported and worked with the president, you’re going to talk about all the policies where you align, you’re going to talk about helping to get all of his judicial nominees through,” he said.

While a potential endorsement from Trump remains a major question, Cornyn does have support from Senate Republicans. Sen. Tim Scott, of South Carolina, who chairs the National Republican Senatorial Committee, has made his case for Cornyn to White House officials.

Scott also told Rep. Wesley Hunt, R-Texas, who has also been weighing a Senate run, that the NRSC is behind Cornyn, according to a source familiar with the discussions.

“John Cornyn is a leader who delivers on President Trump’s agenda and for the people of Texas in the U.S. Senate,” Scott said in a statement to NBC News. “He’s a proven fighter, man of faith and essential part of the Republican Senate Majority.”

Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., has also been publicly backing Cornyn and recently told CNN he was hopeful Trump would back Cornyn in the race.

Asked Wednesday if he has personally asked Trump to endorse Cornyn, Thune told reporters at the Capitol: “Well, we’re having conversations about all of the races on the map. When we have anything to report, we’ll let you know.”

Senate Leadership Fund, the main GOP super PAC involved in Senate races, which is aligned with Republican leadership, indicated it is also in Cornyn's corner.

""Leader John Thune, NRSC Chairman Tim Scott, and many of their colleagues have expressed great admiration and support for Senator John Cornyn and his years of service to the people of Texas,"" SLF Chairman Cory Gardner, a former senator from Colorado, said in a statement to NBC News. ""The Senate Leadership Fund fully intends on seeing him reelected next November.""

Mackowiak, a longtime Texas political consultant, told NBC News that he sees Paxton’s early announcement as an indication of two things: The attorney general sees an opening, but he knows he needs time to raise the money required to combat Cornyn and the power of incumbency.

“Paxton’s never run a race this complicated, this expensive against someone as accomplished and serious as John Cornyn,"" he said. ""John Cornyn has never been challenged by someone that has the statewide profile and grassroots enthusiasm Paxton has.""

But Mackowiak argued that while Paxton has sought to go on offense early, that dynamic may not stick, and that the events that led to Paxton’s impeachment trial (which divided Republicans in the state) will likely be relitigated.

“He is going to be playing a lot more defense than he even understands. I think because he got through impeachment, these issues are behind him. They’re not,” he said.

One potential wrinkle, particularly if Hunt or another Republican decides to jump in, is Texas’ runoff rules. If no candidate wins the majority of the vote in the primary, the top two move on to a one-on-one runoff election.

Cornyn has never lost an election in Texas, and he’s never been forced to a runoff by any of his opponents (who have largely challenged him from the right). But the prospect of a split field leading to a runoff is another complicating factor, with both Mackowiak and Steinhauser noting that runoff electorates typically favor the candidate with more grassroots conservative support.

Senate map

The Texas race could have broader implications for the fight for the Senate next year as Republicans look to defend their slim majority.

Democrats need to net three seats to take control of the Senate, but they face an uphill battle with a short list of targets. Just one Republican — Maine’s Susan Collins — is running in a state that former Vice President Kamala Harris carried in November. Republicans, meanwhile, are looking to grow their majority by targeting Democratic-held seats in battleground states.

But Cornyn said a competitive election in Texas could put a strain on Republicans nationally by diverting money away from other key battlegrounds.

“We’re going to end up spending hundreds of millions of dollars, potentially, on this race in Texas, because we can’t lose the seat in Texas,” said Cornyn, a former NRSC chairman. “And that is money that can’t be used in places like Michigan, New Hampshire and Georgia in the midterm elections.”

Democrats have long coveted the idea of flipping Texas, with former Rep. Beto O’Rourke coming close to defeating Cruz in the blue wave year of 2018. But Trump expanded his margin last year in Texas compared to 2020, carrying Texas by 14 percentage points as Cruz defeated former Democratic Rep. Colin Allred by 9 points.

Allred told The Dallas Morning News last month that he is “seriously considering” another run for Senate against Cornyn. Cruz, meanwhile, told reporters Wednesday that he is staying neutral in this year’s Senate primary, saying both Paxton and Cornyn are friends.

“I have worked closely with both of them. I respect them both,” Cruz said. “And I trust the voters of Texas to make that decision.”

A divisive GOP primary could play into Democrats’ hands — especially if Paxton is the nominee. In the meantime, Democrats are watching the GOP primary process play out in Texas and other states. Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee spokesperson Maeve Coyle noted that former New Hampshire GOP Gov. Chris Sununu announced Tuesday that he would not be running for that state’s open Senate seat.

“As Republicans face a nasty primary in Texas and an embarrassing recruitment failure in New Hampshire — coupled with a building midterm backlash across the map driven by their threats to Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and their push to spike costs for families — Democrats will look for every opportunity to put them on defense,” Coyle said."

WASHINGTON — “Liberation Day” just gave way to Capitulation Day.

President Donald Trump pulled back Wednesday on a series of harsh tariffs targeting friends and foes alike in an audacious bid to remake the global economic order.

Trump's early afternoon announcement followed a harrowing week in which Republican lawmakers and confidants privately warned him that the tariffs could wreck the economy. His own aides had quietly raised alarms about the financial markets before he suspended a tariff regime that he had unveiled with a flourish just one week earlier in a Rose Garden ceremony.

The stock market rose immediately after the about-face, ending days of losses that have forced older Americans who've been sinking their savings into 401(k)s to rethink their retirement plans.

Ahead of Trump's announcement, some of his advisers had been in a near panic about the bond markets, according to a senior administration official. Interest rates on 10-year Treasury bonds had been rising, contrary to what normally happens when stock prices fall and investors seek safety in treasuries. The unusual dynamic meant that at the same time the tariffs could push up prices, people would be paying more to buy homes or pay off credit card debt because of higher interest rates. Businesses looking to expand would pay more for new loans.

Two of Trump's most senior advisers, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, presented a united front Wednesday, urging him to suspend the tariffs in light of the bond market, the administration official said.

In a social media post, Trump announced a 90-day pause that he said he’ll use to negotiate deals with dozens of countries that have expressed openness to revising trade terms that he contends exploit American businesses and workers. One exception is China. Trump upped the tariff on the country’s biggest geopolitical rival to 125%, part of a tit-for-tat escalation in an evolving trade war.

Trump reversed course one week after he appeared in the Rose Garden and unveiled his plan to bring jobs back to the United States. Displaying a chart showing the new, elevated tariffs that countries would face, Trump proclaimed, “My fellow Americans, this is Liberation Day.”

It proved short-lived.

Markets plunged in anticipation of heightened trade wars, wiping out trillions of dollars in wealth. Democrats seized on the issue, looking to undercut a source of Trump’s popular appeal: the view that he can be trusted to steer the nation’s economy.

“Donald Trump’s market crash has vaporized a whopping $104,000 from the average retirement account,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Wednesday on the Senate floor, hours before Trump’s reversal.

The episode laid bare the rifts within Trump’s team of senior advisers as the White House struggled to offer a clear, consistent argument about the duration of the tariffs. While Bessent seemed open to negotiations, Peter Navarro, a senior trade adviser, appeared to take a more hard-line posture.

Elon Musk, the billionaire Tesla CEO who has been advising Trump on the government workforce, called Navarro “dumber than a sack of bricks,” while Navarro described Musk as someone who is merely “a car assembler, in many cases.”

But the weeklong drama also underscored the peril of a policymaking process that is often tied to the wishes and vagaries of one man: Trump.

Asked about the dust-up between Musk and Navarro, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a golf partner of Trump’s, said: “I don’t think it matters. The only one who matters is Trump.”

Markets tend to favor predictability, as do business leaders deciding where to build new plants. When Trump sets a course, however, there are bound to be detours.

A friend of his who spoke to him in recent days said Trump gave no sign he was about to “back down quickly on this stuff.”

Trump believes other countries trade unfairly and sees tariffs as a tool to make the United States more competitive, the person said.

“He’s very confident it’s going to work for him,” the person added, speaking on condition of anonymity.

And yet in the run-up to Wednesday’s announcement, Trump and his aides were also hearing from GOP lawmakers and outside allies urging an alternative path.

One was Larry Kudlow, who hosts a show on Fox Business Network and was a senior economic adviser in Trump’s first term.

Kudlow told NBC News that he has had “ongoing” talks with friends in the West Wing about the need to negotiate with other countries before the United States slaps them with tariffs that stand in perpetuity.

Describing Trump’s move Wednesday as “fabulous,” Kudlow added: “Dealmaking is the best thing to do. In the last 48 hours, Trump has gone from non-negotiating to negotiating. It’s very clear that Bessent is now the point man on trade. Very clear.”

Anxious GOP lawmakers also weighed in.

Graham said he spoke to Trump at length Tuesday night and told him he has been hearing from car manufacturers who are worried about how the tariffs would affect their business. BMW operates a plant in Graham’s home state and is one of the companies he said he has spoken to.

Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., a lawmaker who was also in touch with the administration, said Tuesday that he planned to have lunch with Bessent. On Wednesday, he told NBC News he was also talking to the White House. Kennedy likened Trump to the “pit bull who caught the car.” Now, he said, the question becomes: “What are you going to do with the car?”

After more market losses this week, and with pressure mounting from Republicans on Capitol Hill, Trump began having second thoughts. In his first term, he often viewed the ups and downs of the stock market as a kind of report card on his presidency, celebrating its rise. The downturn had gotten his attention.

“People were getting a little queasy,” he acknowledged Wednesday at an event with NASCAR racing champions.

""Over the last few days,"" he began to more seriously consider pausing the additional tariffs, he told reporters later in the day in an Oval Office appearance. One prospect that intrigued him was personally negotiating new trade deals with the countries looking to get out from under the tariffs, the senior administration official said.

He'd made up his mind. Sitting with Bessent and Lutnick, he crafted the note announcing the 90-day postponement and ending, for the time being, the biggest economic crisis of his young presidency.

“We wrote it from our hearts, right?” Trump said. “It was written as something that I think was very positive for the world and for us, and we don’t want to hurt countries that don’t need to be hurt, and they all want to negotiate.”

The day closed with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up nearly 8%, erasing some — but not all — of the post-“Liberation Day” losses.

Messy as it all may have seemed, his administration insisted that all is unfolding as planned.

""You have been watching the greatest economic master strategy from an American President in history,"" White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller posted Wednesday afternoon."

2,"Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton’s attempt to topple Republican Sen. John Cornyn in a Senate primary next year kicks off one of the most intense contests of the 2026 elections — a GOP-versus-GOP battle between two men who have been sparring for years and vying for President Donald Trump’s attention.

Cornyn is a fixture of the Republican Party in Texas, serving in its highest offices for more than 30 years and becoming a key voice on Capitol Hill. Paxton, the third-term attorney general who survived a bipartisan impeachment last year in part thanks to support from Trump and conservative activist allies, believes there’s an opening to cut the incumbent down from the right.

Now, both sides are aligning themselves with Trump amid the possibility of an endorsement that could tip the primary.

Whether one comes or not, one thing is clear. “This is gonna be the nastiest race in the modern era of Texas politics, period,” former Travis County GOP chairman Matt Mackowiak said.

Paxton immediately attacked Cornyn for having “turned his back on President Trump,” pointing to comments Cornyn made in 2023 about Trump’s indictment over his handling of classified documents, as well as the senator’s comments that he didn’t think Trump “could win the presidency” after Trump was found liable for sexual abuse in a civil case that same year.

Paxton has also targeted Cornyn over his votes on issues including guns and immigration to try to argue that he is more aligned with conservative values.

“While John was criticizing Trump and suggesting he shouldn’t run, I was at Mar-a-Lago” for Trump’s presidential announcement speech, Paxton told “The Mark Davis Show” in Dallas.

""If he had the record of [Texas GOP Sen.] Ted Cruz, would I be here? Absolutely not,"" Paxton continued. ""This isn’t about what he’s saying and the love he suddenly has for President Trump and the love he has for all of our issues now. This isn’t about that love. I don’t believe that love, I believe in action.""

Cornyn, though, also made an appeal to Trump’s interests, telling reporters at the Capitol on Wednesday that Paxton’s Senate bid is a “con man’s vanity project.”

“The biggest potential loser is President Trump’s agenda,” Cornyn said of the primary challenge.

“Mr. Paxton has a checkered background, he is a con man and a fraud, and I think the people of Texas know that, but this is what will be litigated during the course of this campaign. I am not going to turn over the Senate seat that was once held by Sam Houston to someone like him,” he added, a reference to the 2023 impeachment trial of Paxton, after which he survived a conviction vote in the state Senate.

“It’s unclear to me exactly what is motivating Mr. Paxton other than vanity and personal ambition,” Cornyn continued.

In the months before Paxton jumped in — and in the hours since — Cornyn has made clear he’s hugging Trump as tight as he can. He posted on X a photo of him reading Trump’s “The Art of the Deal” and called it “recommended” reading; he took to the Senate floor to defend Trump aide and billionaire Elon Musk (whose businesses have a significant footprint in Texas) after protests at Tesla dealerships; and he has been framing himself as one of Trump’s top allies in the Senate.

A long-simmering feud

The roots of this clash between another establishment-insurgent pair of Republicans run deep, part of a decade-plus battle within the Texas GOP that has ousted legislative leaders, fueled Cruz's rise, fanned the flames of Paxton’s impeachment, and led to proxy wars up and down the ballot.

Paxton had been telegraphing a run against Cornyn from the right for more than a year. In early 2024, Paxton lambasted the senator as “anti-Trump [and] anti-gun” in a post on X, adding that “Texans deserve another conservative Senator.”

Cornyn reposted the message and replied: “Hard to run from prison, Ken,” a reference to the investigations that led to the impeachment trial. (The Associated Press reported this month that the Justice Department decided last year not to prosecute Paxton over corruption allegations.)

Brendan Steinhauser, a longtime GOP consultant who served as Cornyn’s campaign manager in the past but is unaffiliated in this race, told NBC News it’s no surprise to see Cornyn campaign with an eye on Trump.

“If you’re Senator Cornyn, you’re going to be campaigning on all the ways that you have supported and worked with the president, you’re going to talk about all the policies where you align, you’re going to talk about helping to get all of his judicial nominees through,” he said.

While a potential endorsement from Trump remains a major question, Cornyn does have support from Senate Republicans. Sen. Tim Scott, of South Carolina, who chairs the National Republican Senatorial Committee, has made his case for Cornyn to White House officials.

Scott also told Rep. Wesley Hunt, R-Texas, who has also been weighing a Senate run, that the NRSC is behind Cornyn, according to a source familiar with the discussions.

“John Cornyn is a leader who delivers on President Trump’s agenda and for the people of Texas in the U.S. Senate,” Scott said in a statement to NBC News. “He’s a proven fighter, man of faith and essential part of the Republican Senate Majority.”

Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., has also been publicly backing Cornyn and recently told CNN he was hopeful Trump would back Cornyn in the race.

Asked Wednesday if he has personally asked Trump to endorse Cornyn, Thune told reporters at the Capitol: “Well, we’re having conversations about all of the races on the map. When we have anything to report, we’ll let you know.”

Senate Leadership Fund, the main GOP super PAC involved in Senate races, which is aligned with Republican leadership, indicated it is also in Cornyn's corner.

""Leader John Thune, NRSC Chairman Tim Scott, and many of their colleagues have expressed great admiration and support for Senator John Cornyn and his years of service to the people of Texas,"" SLF Chairman Cory Gardner, a former senator from Colorado, said in a statement to NBC News. ""The Senate Leadership Fund fully intends on seeing him reelected next November.""

Mackowiak, a longtime Texas political consultant, told NBC News that he sees Paxton’s early announcement as an indication of two things: The attorney general sees an opening, but he knows he needs time to raise the money required to combat Cornyn and the power of incumbency.

“Paxton’s never run a race this complicated, this expensive against someone as accomplished and serious as John Cornyn,"" he said. ""John Cornyn has never been challenged by someone that has the statewide profile and grassroots enthusiasm Paxton has.""

But Mackowiak argued that while Paxton has sought to go on offense early, that dynamic may not stick, and that the events that led to Paxton’s impeachment trial (which divided Republicans in the state) will likely be relitigated.

“He is going to be playing a lot more defense than he even understands. I think because he got through impeachment, these issues are behind him. They’re not,” he said.

One potential wrinkle, particularly if Hunt or another Republican decides to jump in, is Texas’ runoff rules. If no candidate wins the majority of the vote in the primary, the top two move on to a one-on-one runoff election.

Cornyn has never lost an election in Texas, and he’s never been forced to a runoff by any of his opponents (who have largely challenged him from the right). But the prospect of a split field leading to a runoff is another complicating factor, with both Mackowiak and Steinhauser noting that runoff electorates typically favor the candidate with more grassroots conservative support.

Senate map

The Texas race could have broader implications for the fight for the Senate next year as Republicans look to defend their slim majority.

Democrats need to net three seats to take control of the Senate, but they face an uphill battle with a short list of targets. Just one Republican — Maine’s Susan Collins — is running in a state that former Vice President Kamala Harris carried in November. Republicans, meanwhile, are looking to grow their majority by targeting Democratic-held seats in battleground states.

But Cornyn said a competitive election in Texas could put a strain on Republicans nationally by diverting money away from other key battlegrounds.

“We’re going to end up spending hundreds of millions of dollars, potentially, on this race in Texas, because we can’t lose the seat in Texas,” said Cornyn, a former NRSC chairman. “And that is money that can’t be used in places like Michigan, New Hampshire and Georgia in the midterm elections.”

Democrats have long coveted the idea of flipping Texas, with former Rep. Beto O’Rourke coming close to defeating Cruz in the blue wave year of 2018. But Trump expanded his margin last year in Texas compared to 2020, carrying Texas by 14 percentage points as Cruz defeated former Democratic Rep. Colin Allred by 9 points.

Allred told The Dallas Morning News last month that he is “seriously considering” another run for Senate against Cornyn. Cruz, meanwhile, told reporters Wednesday that he is staying neutral in this year’s Senate primary, saying both Paxton and Cornyn are friends.

“I have worked closely with both of them. I respect them both,” Cruz said. “And I trust the voters of Texas to make that decision.”

A divisive GOP primary could play into Democrats’ hands — especially if Paxton is the nominee. In the meantime, Democrats are watching the GOP primary process play out in Texas and other states. Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee spokesperson Maeve Coyle noted that former New Hampshire GOP Gov. Chris Sununu announced Tuesday that he would not be running for that state’s open Senate seat.

“As Republicans face a nasty primary in Texas and an embarrassing recruitment failure in New Hampshire — coupled with a building midterm backlash across the map driven by their threats to Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and their push to spike costs for families — Democrats will look for every opportunity to put them on defense,” Coyle said."

150,"WASHINGTON — As President Donald Trump ramps up attacks on the judiciary, the Republican-led House voted Wednesday to limit district court judges’ ability to issue the nationwide injunctions that have hampered some of his executive actions.

The vote was 219-213, with just one Republican, Mike Turner of Ohio, joining all Democrats in opposing it. The bill now heads to the Senate, where it would almost certainly be blocked by a Democratic filibuster if it were brought to the floor.

Trump and many of his allies on the far right had been pushing House Republicans to take a more extreme step and attempt to impeach judges that stood in his way.

The ""No Rogue Rulings Act,"" authored by Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., doesn’t go that far, but it allows House Republicans to voice their support for Trump on the issue while avoiding politically perilous impeachment votes that would be all but doomed to fail.

Follow live politics coverage here

In a brief interview, Issa argued that both parties would benefit from the legislation. He said that during President Joe Biden's administration, Democrats howled when conservative judges issued nationwide injunctions against his executive actions.

""This is a growing problem that has vexed both Republican and Democrat presidents,"" Issa, a senior member of the Judiciary Committee and the former chairman of the Oversight Committee, said before the vote. Biden, ""to the very end, was trying to get this process of activist judges exceeding their jurisdiction rolled back.""

This bill, Issa said, ""limits judges to the original intent, which will allow them to make decisions but only as to the plaintiffs.""

Trump and his allies have grown frustrated with lower-court judges’ issuing injunctions blocking Trump’s actions on deportations of undocumented immigrants, sweeping cuts and mass firings at federal agencies, ending birthright citizenship and other matters.

Much of Republicans' criticism has centered on U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, who halted Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants alleged to be Tren de Aragua gang members.

After that decision, Rep. Brandon Gill, R-Texas, a Trump ally, introduced a resolution to impeach Boasberg, who is based in Washington, D.C. Other judges who have ruled against Trump also have faced impeachment threats, including U.S. District Judges Paul A. Engelmayer and John Bates.

But GOP leaders have acknowledged such impeachment resolutions wouldn't have enough support to pass out of the House, where Republicans hold a narrow 220-213 majority.

On top of that, 67 votes would be needed for convictions in the Senate, where Republicans have a 53-47 majority.

In some high-profile cases, the conservative-leaning Supreme Court has been ruling in Trump’s favor. On Monday, it tossed out Boasberg’s decision blocking the removal of the alleged gang members to El Salvador.

A day later, the Supreme Court halted a ruling by U.S. District Judge William Alsup of California requiring some federal agencies to reinstate roughly 16,000 workers the Trump administration had tried to fire.

Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, said his party in the past has tried to block ""judicial forum shopping,"" in which plaintiffs try to pick courts where they have higher chances of winning.

""But a nationwide injunction is a necessary part of the judicial tool kit,"" said Raskin, a former constitutional law professor. ""Why should every person affected [by an issue] have to go to court? Why should millions of people have to create their own case?""

""Why should Brown vs. Board of Education have applied to just Linda Brown as opposed to everybody affected?"" he added."

President Donald Trump directed federal agencies Wednesday to revoke the security clearances and review the activities of two high-level former government officials who questioned his election fraud claims and his conduct in his first term.

Christopher Krebs, the former head of the federal government's top cybersecurity agency, said Joe Biden won the 2020 elections, contradicting Trump's claim that the election was stolen.

Miles Taylor, a former Department of Homeland Security official, wrote an anonymous memoir that criticized Trump's handling of classified documents and other conduct during his first term.

One memorandum Trump signed directed the attorney general and the homeland security secretary to ""take all appropriate action to review"" Krebs' activities. Another directed the homeland security secretary to review Taylor’s activities as a government employee.

The memo relating to Krebs described him as a ""significant bad-faith actor who weaponized and abused his Government authority.""

The other memo said Taylor ""stoked dissension by manufacturing sensationalist reports on the existence of a supposed 'resistance' within the Federal Government.""

Krebs declined to comment. Taylor said on X that he wasn't surprised by Trump's actions.

“I said this would happen,” Taylor wrote. “Dissent isn’t unlawful. It certainly isn’t treasonous. America is headed down a dark path.”

He added: “Never has a man so inelegantly proved another man’s point.”

Taylor wrote an anonymous op-ed while he was working at the Department of Homeland Security in which he said many senior administration officials were trying to limit Trump’s impulses and frustrate his agenda.

In his memoir, Taylor describes having heard about Trump’s interest in “tapping” White House aides’ phones in a bid to stanch media leaks.

Krebs was the first director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, which during the Trump administration began offering cybersecurity and physical security help to state and local election officials.

Trump fired Krebs in a tweet in November 2020 over the agency’s Rumor Control website, which corrected falsehoods about election integrity, many of which Trump and his allies promoted.

Krebs was among the most vocal government officials debunking baseless claims about election manipulation, particularly addressing a conspiracy theory centered on Dominion Voting Systems machines that Trump's lawyers have pushed.

As a prominent critic of Trump’s false claims that the election 2020 was stolen, Krebs has been a consistent target for Trump.

Rep. Jim Himes, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, condemned Trump’s attack on Krebs.

“Krebs executed his constitutional and professional duty by debunking lies about the 2020 election,"" Hime said in an email. ""That Donald Trump would wield the Justice Department against him for such an act represents yet another chilling step towards authoritarianism."""

WASHINGTON — “Liberation Day” just gave way to Capitulation Day.

President Donald Trump pulled back Wednesday on a series of harsh tariffs targeting friends and foes alike in an audacious bid to remake the global economic order.

Trump's early afternoon announcement followed a harrowing week in which Republican lawmakers and confidants privately warned him that the tariffs could wreck the economy. His own aides had quietly raised alarms about the financial markets before he suspended a tariff regime that he had unveiled with a flourish just one week earlier in a Rose Garden ceremony.

The stock market rose immediately after the about-face, ending days of losses that have forced older Americans who've been sinking their savings into 401(k)s to rethink their retirement plans.

Ahead of Trump's announcement, some of his advisers had been in a near panic about the bond markets, according to a senior administration official. Interest rates on 10-year Treasury bonds had been rising, contrary to what normally happens when stock prices fall and investors seek safety in treasuries. The unusual dynamic meant that at the same time the tariffs could push up prices, people would be paying more to buy homes or pay off credit card debt because of higher interest rates. Businesses looking to expand would pay more for new loans.

Two of Trump's most senior advisers, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, presented a united front Wednesday, urging him to suspend the tariffs in light of the bond market, the administration official said.

In a social media post, Trump announced a 90-day pause that he said he’ll use to negotiate deals with dozens of countries that have expressed openness to revising trade terms that he contends exploit American businesses and workers. One exception is China. Trump upped the tariff on the country’s biggest geopolitical rival to 125%, part of a tit-for-tat escalation in an evolving trade war.

Trump reversed course one week after he appeared in the Rose Garden and unveiled his plan to bring jobs back to the United States. Displaying a chart showing the new, elevated tariffs that countries would face, Trump proclaimed, “My fellow Americans, this is Liberation Day.”

It proved short-lived.

Markets plunged in anticipation of heightened trade wars, wiping out trillions of dollars in wealth. Democrats seized on the issue, looking to undercut a source of Trump’s popular appeal: the view that he can be trusted to steer the nation’s economy.

“Donald Trump’s market crash has vaporized a whopping $104,000 from the average retirement account,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Wednesday on the Senate floor, hours before Trump’s reversal.

The episode laid bare the rifts within Trump’s team of senior advisers as the White House struggled to offer a clear, consistent argument about the duration of the tariffs. While Bessent seemed open to negotiations, Peter Navarro, a senior trade adviser, appeared to take a more hard-line posture.

Elon Musk, the billionaire Tesla CEO who has been advising Trump on the government workforce, called Navarro “dumber than a sack of bricks,” while Navarro described Musk as someone who is merely “a car assembler, in many cases.”

But the weeklong drama also underscored the peril of a policymaking process that is often tied to the wishes and vagaries of one man: Trump.

Asked about the dust-up between Musk and Navarro, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a golf partner of Trump’s, said: “I don’t think it matters. The only one who matters is Trump.”

Markets tend to favor predictability, as do business leaders deciding where to build new plants. When Trump sets a course, however, there are bound to be detours.

A friend of his who spoke to him in recent days said Trump gave no sign he was about to “back down quickly on this stuff.”

Trump believes other countries trade unfairly and sees tariffs as a tool to make the United States more competitive, the person said.

“He’s very confident it’s going to work for him,” the person added, speaking on condition of anonymity.

And yet in the run-up to Wednesday’s announcement, Trump and his aides were also hearing from GOP lawmakers and outside allies urging an alternative path.

One was Larry Kudlow, who hosts a show on Fox Business Network and was a senior economic adviser in Trump’s first term.

Kudlow told NBC News that he has had “ongoing” talks with friends in the West Wing about the need to negotiate with other countries before the United States slaps them with tariffs that stand in perpetuity.

Describing Trump’s move Wednesday as “fabulous,” Kudlow added: “Dealmaking is the best thing to do. In the last 48 hours, Trump has gone from non-negotiating to negotiating. It’s very clear that Bessent is now the point man on trade. Very clear.”

Anxious GOP lawmakers also weighed in.

Graham said he spoke to Trump at length Tuesday night and told him he has been hearing from car manufacturers who are worried about how the tariffs would affect their business. BMW operates a plant in Graham’s home state and is one of the companies he said he has spoken to.

Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., a lawmaker who was also in touch with the administration, said Tuesday that he planned to have lunch with Bessent. On Wednesday, he told NBC News he was also talking to the White House. Kennedy likened Trump to the “pit bull who caught the car.” Now, he said, the question becomes: “What are you going to do with the car?”

After more market losses this week, and with pressure mounting from Republicans on Capitol Hill, Trump began having second thoughts. In his first term, he often viewed the ups and downs of the stock market as a kind of report card on his presidency, celebrating its rise. The downturn had gotten his attention.

“People were getting a little queasy,” he acknowledged Wednesday at an event with NASCAR racing champions.

""Over the last few days,"" he began to more seriously consider pausing the additional tariffs, he told reporters later in the day in an Oval Office appearance. One prospect that intrigued him was personally negotiating new trade deals with the countries looking to get out from under the tariffs, the senior administration official said.

He'd made up his mind. Sitting with Bessent and Lutnick, he crafted the note announcing the 90-day postponement and ending, for the time being, the biggest economic crisis of his young presidency.

“We wrote it from our hearts, right?” Trump said. “It was written as something that I think was very positive for the world and for us, and we don’t want to hurt countries that don’t need to be hurt, and they all want to negotiate.”

The day closed with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up nearly 8%, erasing some — but not all — of the post-“Liberation Day” losses.

Messy as it all may have seemed, his administration insisted that all is unfolding as planned.

""You have been watching the greatest economic master strategy from an American President in history,"" White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller posted Wednesday afternoon."

President Donald Trump directed federal agencies Wednesday to revoke the security clearances and review the activities of two high-level former government officials who questioned his election fraud claims and his conduct in his first term.

Christopher Krebs, the former head of the federal government's top cybersecurity agency, said Joe Biden won the 2020 elections, contradicting Trump's claim that the election was stolen.

Miles Taylor, a former Department of Homeland Security official, wrote an anonymous memoir that criticized Trump's handling of classified documents and other conduct during his first term.

One memorandum Trump signed directed the attorney general and the homeland security secretary to ""take all appropriate action to review"" Krebs' activities. Another directed the homeland security secretary to review Taylor’s activities as a government employee.

The memo relating to Krebs described him as a ""significant bad-faith actor who weaponized and abused his Government authority.""

The other memo said Taylor ""stoked dissension by manufacturing sensationalist reports on the existence of a supposed 'resistance' within the Federal Government.""

Krebs declined to comment. Taylor said on X that he wasn't surprised by Trump's actions.

“I said this would happen,” Taylor wrote. “Dissent isn’t unlawful. It certainly isn’t treasonous. America is headed down a dark path.”

He added: “Never has a man so inelegantly proved another man’s point.”

Taylor wrote an anonymous op-ed while he was working at the Department of Homeland Security in which he said many senior administration officials were trying to limit Trump’s impulses and frustrate his agenda.

In his memoir, Taylor describes having heard about Trump’s interest in “tapping” White House aides’ phones in a bid to stanch media leaks.

Krebs was the first director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, which during the Trump administration began offering cybersecurity and physical security help to state and local election officials.

Trump fired Krebs in a tweet in November 2020 over the agency’s Rumor Control website, which corrected falsehoods about election integrity, many of which Trump and his allies promoted.

Krebs was among the most vocal government officials debunking baseless claims about election manipulation, particularly addressing a conspiracy theory centered on Dominion Voting Systems machines that Trump's lawyers have pushed.

As a prominent critic of Trump’s false claims that the election 2020 was stolen, Krebs has been a consistent target for Trump.

Rep. Jim Himes, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, condemned Trump’s attack on Krebs.

“Krebs executed his constitutional and professional duty by debunking lies about the 2020 election,"" Hime said in an email. ""That Donald Trump would wield the Justice Department against him for such an act represents yet another chilling step towards authoritarianism."""

110,"In the wake of President Donald Trump’s announcement Wednesday afternoon that he was pausing country-by-country tariffs by 90 days, some experts — as well as critics of Trump and social media users — are raising questions about a statement he posted earlier in the day that may have indicated the massive sell-off in stocks in recent days was coming to an end.

Not long after trading opened at 9:30 a.m. Wednesday, Trump took to his Truth Social platform and wrote:

“BE COOL! Everything is going to work out well. The USA will be bigger and better than ever before!”

Four minutes later, he wrote:

“THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!! DJT”

Just before 1:30 p.m., Trump announced the pause, sending stocks soaring. The tech-heavy Nasdaq index had its biggest one-day gain since 2008, rising nearly 12%, while the S&P 500 climbed 9.5% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 8%, or about 2,800 points.

Trump could have been generally urging people to buy into the market while prices were relatively low. That was the response Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick gave when he was asked about the posts Wednesday evening on CNBC.

“Donald Trump understands that … America is the greatest country, all right? We are the greatest country, and we have the capacity for incredible greatness. But someone needs to take the shackles off.”

But on social media, some users raised the prospect — without evidence — of market manipulation, while others began referring to the market’s sharp turn upward as the “Trump Pump.”

There is no evidence to suggest that Trump was seeking to manipulate markets or that he or any of his advisers acted on inside information

For Richard Painter, chief ethics lawyer for former President George W. Bush, who now teaches government ethics and security regulation at the University of Minnesota’s law school, the morning posts, at a minimum, leave Trump open to questions about his intentions.

“This is a scenario that could expose the president to accusations that he engaged in market manipulation,” Painter said.

Even before he’d been sworn in for his second term, Trump faced insider-trading criticisms amid the launch of his $TRUMP meme coin. In that incident, the Trump Organization was explicit that a group of investors who were helping launch the coin stood to benefit from its release assuming its price went up. Still, reports showed other investors reaping outsized profits from the launch, including one crypto-wallet owner or owners who earned $109 million, according to a New York Times analysis.

Some Democrats were quick to blast Trump’s actions on Wednesday.

""An insider trading scandal is brewing,"" Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., posted on X.

Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., told NBC News that the Trump administration is “replete with grifters” and that “corruption is its middle name.”

“Insider trading is a real threat, and I hope there will be a surge of penetrating investigations into the potential for manipulation and insider trading of securities,” Blumenthal said, “since the knowledge of what Trump’s plans have been and may be is widely spread.”

Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif. — a frequent object of Trump’s scorn — also suggested an inquiry was warranted.

“Trump is creating giant market fluctuations with his on-again, off-again tariffs,” Schiff wrote on social media. “These constant gyrations in policy provide dangerous opportunities for insider trading. Who in the administration knew about Trump’s latest tariff flip flop ahead of time? Did anyone buy or sell stocks, and profit at the public’s expense? I’m writing to the White House — the public has a right to know.”

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., pointed to the upcoming May 15 deadline for members of Congress to submit their financial disclosure reports, writing on X, ""Any member of Congress who purchased stocks in the last 48 hours should probably disclose that now. I’ve been hearing some interesting chatter on the floor.""

A White House spokesman rejected the Democrats’ assertions.

“It is the responsibility of the President of the United States to reassure the markets and Americans about their economic security in the face of nonstop media fearmongering,” White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement. “Instead of grasping at straws to try landing a punch on President Trump, Democrats should focus on working with the administration to restore American Greatness.”

A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment. The Securities and Exchange Commission did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Painter said the incident could result in investigations “into who knew what and when before [Trump] announced he was going to postpone the tariffs on all the countries except for China.”

“This was a terrible idea to make those posts,” Painter said of Trump’s suggestion that it was “a great time to buy.”

Painter further admonished Trump, saying, “I would hope that he would focus on doing his job — and try to calm the markets and have a predictable trade policy and let the markets do their thing without the White House giving what appears to be investment advice.”"

Trump abruptly backs off major tariff plan after days of turmoil

By Rob Wile, Colleen Long and Shannon Pettypiece

One week after his “Liberation Day,” President Donald Trump said he was pausing higher targeted tariffs for most countries for 90 days, a stunning reversal in his trade war that sent markets reeling.

In a social media post just before 1:30 p.m., Trump wrote that he came to the decision because more than 75 trading partners did not retaliate and have reached out to the United States to “discuss” some of the issues he had raised.

But the pause didn’t apply to China, which has retaliated with 84% hikes. Trump instead raised duties for it to 125%, effective immediately.

Zooming out: The trade war isn’t exactly over, and the pause didn’t return the world to the time before Trump touched off the global instability. A 10% across-the-board duty will remain — including for some products from Canada and Mexico.

The White House wouldn’t say which countries would be covered by the pause. Earlier Wednesday the European Union voted to impose fresh retaliatory duties, but they aren’t set to take effect until next week.

And separate tariffs on imported autos, steel and aluminum will remain, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said later — while planned tariffs on items like lumber and pharmaceuticals are still on.

How Wall Street responded: Markets soared on the surprising news Wednesday, with the S&P 500 climbing more than 9%, the tech-heavy Nasdaq closing up more than 12% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average ending nearly 3,000 points higher.

Goldman Sachs lowered its odds of a recession but said it is still forecasting minimal economic growth and a 45% probability of a recession given the remaining tariffs in place.

What Trump said: Trump appeared to dig in on his tariff plan just hours earlier, telling Americans “BE COOL” on Truth Social. And he suggested not that long ago that the tariffs could be permanent.

“I thought that people were jumping a little bit out of line. They were getting yippie, you know, they were getting a little bit yippie, a little bit afraid,” he told reporters at the White House.

“So we’ll see how it all works out. I think it’s going to work out amazing,” he added.

Paxton kicks off a bitter GOP primary battle against Cornyn

By Ben Kamisar, Bridget Bowman and Frank Thorp V

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton’s attempt to topple Republican Sen. John Cornyn in a primary next year kicks off one of the most intense contests of the 2026 elections — an intraparty battle between two men who have been sparring for years and vying for President Donald Trump’s attention.

Cornyn is a fixture of the Republican Party in Texas, serving in its highest offices for more than 30 years and becoming a key voice on Capitol Hill. Paxton, the third-term attorney general who survived a bipartisan impeachment last year in part thanks to support from Trump and conservative activist allies, believes there’s an opening to cut him down from the right.

Now, both sides are aligning themselves with Trump amid the possibility of an endorsement that could tip the primary.

Whether one comes or not, one thing is clear. “This is gonna be the nastiest race in the modern era of Texas politics, period,” former Travis County GOP chairman Matt Mackowiak said.

Direct or indirect, the U.S. and Iran are set for critical talks this weekend

By Andrea Mitchell

With the threat of U.S. military action against Iran’s suspected nuclear weapons program hanging in the balance — a program Tehran insists is for peaceful purposes — officials from the Trump administration and Iran will meet in the Persian Gulf island nation of Oman this weekend to open talks about holding nuclear negotiations.

The United States will be represented not by Secretary of State Marco Rubio but by special envoy Steve Witkoff. Leading the talks for Iran: Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, a veteran of nuclear negotiations. But so far, the two sides can’t even agree on the nature of the talks.

President Donald Trump told reporters they would be holding direct talks, which Iran has rejected since Trump withdrew in 2018 from the multinational Iran nuclear deal President Barack Obama’s secretary of state, John Kerry, negotiated three years earlier. Araghchi says they’ve agreed only to hold indirect talks, exchanging proposals through diplomatic go-betweens as they’d done with the Biden administration for two years, which went nowhere.

The stakes are serious: Iran has been processing nuclear fuel so rapidly it now has the ability to create one bomb within a week or two, according to the United Nations, former Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Trump administration warnings — though it would still take an estimated year or longer for Tehran to be able to create a warhead small enough for one of its ballistic missiles to carry.

Why are the talks so critical? Trump warned Monday that “it’s getting to be very dangerous territory, and hopefully those talks will be successful. And I think it would be in Iran’s best interests if they are successful.” Last month, he was more explicit, telling “Meet the Press” moderator Kristen Welker, “If they don’t make a deal, there will be bombing, and it will be bombing the likes of which they have never seen before.”

Multiple U.S. officials told NBC News that Iran is vulnerable to an attack: Israel’s retaliatory strike against Iran last fall eliminated many of Tehran’s air defenses. Israel has also killed the leader of Hezbollah, Iran’s proxy and front line of defense in neighboring Lebanon. Hamas’ leaders in Gaza, also Iran’s proxies, are gone. So is Tehran’s powerful ally in Syria, Bashar al-Assad. Trump has repeatedly signaled that he doesn’t want a war with Iran. To avoid one, the two sides have to at least agree, finally, to come face to face.

53,"In the wake of President Donald Trump’s announcement Wednesday afternoon that he was pausing country-by-country tariffs by 90 days, some experts — as well as critics of Trump and social media users — are raising questions about a statement he posted earlier in the day that may have indicated the massive sell-off in stocks in recent days was coming to an end.

Not long after trading opened at 9:30 a.m. Wednesday, Trump took to his Truth Social platform and wrote:

“BE COOL! Everything is going to work out well. The USA will be bigger and better than ever before!”

Four minutes later, he wrote:

“THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!! DJT”

Just before 1:30 p.m., Trump announced the pause, sending stocks soaring. The tech-heavy Nasdaq index had its biggest one-day gain since 2008, rising nearly 12%, while the S&P 500 climbed 9.5% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 8%, or about 2,800 points.

Trump could have been generally urging people to buy into the market while prices were relatively low. That was the response Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick gave when he was asked about the posts Wednesday evening on CNBC.

“Donald Trump understands that … America is the greatest country, all right? We are the greatest country, and we have the capacity for incredible greatness. But someone needs to take the shackles off.”

But on social media, some users raised the prospect — without evidence — of market manipulation, while others began referring to the market’s sharp turn upward as the “Trump Pump.”

There is no evidence to suggest that Trump was seeking to manipulate markets or that he or any of his advisers acted on inside information

For Richard Painter, chief ethics lawyer for former President George W. Bush, who now teaches government ethics and security regulation at the University of Minnesota’s law school, the morning posts, at a minimum, leave Trump open to questions about his intentions.

“This is a scenario that could expose the president to accusations that he engaged in market manipulation,” Painter said.

Even before he’d been sworn in for his second term, Trump faced insider-trading criticisms amid the launch of his $TRUMP meme coin. In that incident, the Trump Organization was explicit that a group of investors who were helping launch the coin stood to benefit from its release assuming its price went up. Still, reports showed other investors reaping outsized profits from the launch, including one crypto-wallet owner or owners who earned $109 million, according to a New York Times analysis.

Some Democrats were quick to blast Trump’s actions on Wednesday.

""An insider trading scandal is brewing,"" Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., posted on X.

Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., told NBC News that the Trump administration is “replete with grifters” and that “corruption is its middle name.”

“Insider trading is a real threat, and I hope there will be a surge of penetrating investigations into the potential for manipulation and insider trading of securities,” Blumenthal said, “since the knowledge of what Trump’s plans have been and may be is widely spread.”

Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif. — a frequent object of Trump’s scorn — also suggested an inquiry was warranted.

“Trump is creating giant market fluctuations with his on-again, off-again tariffs,” Schiff wrote on social media. “These constant gyrations in policy provide dangerous opportunities for insider trading. Who in the administration knew about Trump’s latest tariff flip flop ahead of time? Did anyone buy or sell stocks, and profit at the public’s expense? I’m writing to the White House — the public has a right to know.”

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., pointed to the upcoming May 15 deadline for members of Congress to submit their financial disclosure reports, writing on X, ""Any member of Congress who purchased stocks in the last 48 hours should probably disclose that now. I’ve been hearing some interesting chatter on the floor.""

A White House spokesman rejected the Democrats’ assertions.

“It is the responsibility of the President of the United States to reassure the markets and Americans about their economic security in the face of nonstop media fearmongering,” White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement. “Instead of grasping at straws to try landing a punch on President Trump, Democrats should focus on working with the administration to restore American Greatness.”

A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment. The Securities and Exchange Commission did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Painter said the incident could result in investigations “into who knew what and when before [Trump] announced he was going to postpone the tariffs on all the countries except for China.”

“This was a terrible idea to make those posts,” Painter said of Trump’s suggestion that it was “a great time to buy.”

Painter further admonished Trump, saying, “I would hope that he would focus on doing his job — and try to calm the markets and have a predictable trade policy and let the markets do their thing without the White House giving what appears to be investment advice.”"

Trump abruptly backs off major tariff plan after days of turmoil

By Rob Wile, Colleen Long and Shannon Pettypiece

One week after his “Liberation Day,” President Donald Trump said he was pausing higher targeted tariffs for most countries for 90 days, a stunning reversal in his trade war that sent markets reeling.

In a social media post just before 1:30 p.m., Trump wrote that he came to the decision because more than 75 trading partners did not retaliate and have reached out to the United States to “discuss” some of the issues he had raised.

But the pause didn’t apply to China, which has retaliated with 84% hikes. Trump instead raised duties for it to 125%, effective immediately.

Zooming out: The trade war isn’t exactly over, and the pause didn’t return the world to the time before Trump touched off the global instability. A 10% across-the-board duty will remain — including for some products from Canada and Mexico.

The White House wouldn’t say which countries would be covered by the pause. Earlier Wednesday the European Union voted to impose fresh retaliatory duties, but they aren’t set to take effect until next week.

And separate tariffs on imported autos, steel and aluminum will remain, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said later — while planned tariffs on items like lumber and pharmaceuticals are still on.

How Wall Street responded: Markets soared on the surprising news Wednesday, with the S&P 500 climbing more than 9%, the tech-heavy Nasdaq closing up more than 12% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average ending nearly 3,000 points higher.

Goldman Sachs lowered its odds of a recession but said it is still forecasting minimal economic growth and a 45% probability of a recession given the remaining tariffs in place.

What Trump said: Trump appeared to dig in on his tariff plan just hours earlier, telling Americans “BE COOL” on Truth Social. And he suggested not that long ago that the tariffs could be permanent.

“I thought that people were jumping a little bit out of line. They were getting yippie, you know, they were getting a little bit yippie, a little bit afraid,” he told reporters at the White House.

“So we’ll see how it all works out. I think it’s going to work out amazing,” he added.

Paxton kicks off a bitter GOP primary battle against Cornyn

By Ben Kamisar, Bridget Bowman and Frank Thorp V

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton’s attempt to topple Republican Sen. John Cornyn in a primary next year kicks off one of the most intense contests of the 2026 elections — an intraparty battle between two men who have been sparring for years and vying for President Donald Trump’s attention.

Cornyn is a fixture of the Republican Party in Texas, serving in its highest offices for more than 30 years and becoming a key voice on Capitol Hill. Paxton, the third-term attorney general who survived a bipartisan impeachment last year in part thanks to support from Trump and conservative activist allies, believes there’s an opening to cut him down from the right.

Now, both sides are aligning themselves with Trump amid the possibility of an endorsement that could tip the primary.

Whether one comes or not, one thing is clear. “This is gonna be the nastiest race in the modern era of Texas politics, period,” former Travis County GOP chairman Matt Mackowiak said.

Direct or indirect, the U.S. and Iran are set for critical talks this weekend

By Andrea Mitchell

With the threat of U.S. military action against Iran’s suspected nuclear weapons program hanging in the balance — a program Tehran insists is for peaceful purposes — officials from the Trump administration and Iran will meet in the Persian Gulf island nation of Oman this weekend to open talks about holding nuclear negotiations.

The United States will be represented not by Secretary of State Marco Rubio but by special envoy Steve Witkoff. Leading the talks for Iran: Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, a veteran of nuclear negotiations. But so far, the two sides can’t even agree on the nature of the talks.

President Donald Trump told reporters they would be holding direct talks, which Iran has rejected since Trump withdrew in 2018 from the multinational Iran nuclear deal President Barack Obama’s secretary of state, John Kerry, negotiated three years earlier. Araghchi says they’ve agreed only to hold indirect talks, exchanging proposals through diplomatic go-betweens as they’d done with the Biden administration for two years, which went nowhere.

The stakes are serious: Iran has been processing nuclear fuel so rapidly it now has the ability to create one bomb within a week or two, according to the United Nations, former Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Trump administration warnings — though it would still take an estimated year or longer for Tehran to be able to create a warhead small enough for one of its ballistic missiles to carry.

Why are the talks so critical? Trump warned Monday that “it’s getting to be very dangerous territory, and hopefully those talks will be successful. And I think it would be in Iran’s best interests if they are successful.” Last month, he was more explicit, telling “Meet the Press” moderator Kristen Welker, “If they don’t make a deal, there will be bombing, and it will be bombing the likes of which they have never seen before.”

Multiple U.S. officials told NBC News that Iran is vulnerable to an attack: Israel’s retaliatory strike against Iran last fall eliminated many of Tehran’s air defenses. Israel has also killed the leader of Hezbollah, Iran’s proxy and front line of defense in neighboring Lebanon. Hamas’ leaders in Gaza, also Iran’s proxies, are gone. So is Tehran’s powerful ally in Syria, Bashar al-Assad. Trump has repeatedly signaled that he doesn’t want a war with Iran. To avoid one, the two sides have to at least agree, finally, to come face to face.

153,"Gretchen Whitmer became governor after promising to “fix the damn roads” in Michigan.

Whether she goes any further depends on how well she can navigate some of the early bumps surfacing as she positions herself for a possible White House bid.

On Wednesday, during a trip to Washington, D.C., that put a spotlight on her prospects in 2028, Whitmer hit what many of her fellow Democrats saw as two sizable potholes.

First, in a policy speech outlining a “consistent national strategy,” Whitmer staked out common ground with President Donald Trump. And though Whitmer criticized Trump’s sweeping, roller-coaster rollout of — and subsequent retreat from — tariffs, she said she was not against tariffs “outright” and expressed understanding of Trump’s “motivation” behind deploying them. That drew a social media rebuke from Colorado’s Democratic governor, Jared Polis.

“Tariffs are bad outright because they lead to higher prices and destroy American manufacturing,” Polis, another potential 2028 contender who has also sought ways to find common cause with Trump, wrote on X. “Trade is inherently good because both parties emerge better off from a consensual transaction.”

Then, later Wednesday, Whitmer joined Trump in the Oval Office. She was scheduled to meet privately with him and discuss Michigan issues. That wasn’t how it ultimately played out.

Instead, she stood by as he signed several executive orders, including two calling for Justice Department probes of officials who served in his first administration and called him out for falsely claiming the 2020 election was stolen. He made the false claims about the election’s being “rigged” again Wednesday.

Whitmer was invited into the Oval Office alongside Michigan state House Speaker Matt Hall, a Republican, as Trump held court with reporters and signed the executive orders. Photos showed Whitmer standing uncomfortably against a door as the cameras rolled.

“She’s really done an excellent job,” Trump said of Whitmer during the impromptu media availability. “Very good person.”

Though Trump did engage with her on issues she came to discuss, the fact that she was present at what amounted to a bipartisan photo opportunity as he took actions targeting political critics angered and confused allies.

“Just a f---ing disaster,” said a Democratic operative who admires Whitmer and, like others interviewed for this article, was granted anonymity to share candid thoughts about her day. “It feels like it removes some of the momentum she had as a politically savvy swing-state Dem.”

Whitmer’s team moved quickly to contain the fallout and counter mounting criticism from within her party.

“The governor was surprised that she was brought into the Oval Office during President Trump’s press conference without any notice of the subject matter,” a Whitmer spokesperson said in a statement. “Her presence is not an endorsement of the actions taken or statements made at that event.”

Democrats have long seen Whitmer as one of the party’s more formidable figures — a two-term governor of a battleground state who won re-election in a landslide and was nearly tapped to be Joe Biden’s running mate in 2020 after having considerably raised her public profile during the Covid pandemic. Whitmer is among a handful of prominent Democratic governors viewed as potential presidential contenders in 2028.

But unlike some of her contemporaries, Whitmer has chosen to seek out a stronger working relationship with Trump in his second term. Trump won her state last fall, and Whitmer views herself as more of a center-left moderate with a middle-of-the-road, Midwestern constituency — one that is receptive to Trump’s message, including and especially on manufacturing and tariff policy.

In her Washington speech Wednesday, Whitmer called for cutting red tape and building more in the United States. She also railed against “partisanship,” saying it has seemingly “infected every aspect of our lives, and it’s exhausting.”

“Let’s give more hard-working people a fair shot at a decent life,” she said. “And let’s usher in, as President Trump says, a ‘Golden Age’ of American manufacturing.”

She did break with Trump on the more substantial tariffs he announced last week and partially paused later Wednesday afternoon, describing them as a “triple whammy: higher costs, fewer jobs and more uncertainty.”

“I understand the motivation behind the tariffs, and I can tell you here’s where President Trump and I do agree,” she said. “We do need to make more stuff in America — more cars and chips, more steel and ships. We do need fair trade.”

Her stance on tariffs puts her at odds with other potential Democratic presidential hopefuls, like Polis and Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, who offered sharp criticism of Trump’s “wrongheaded” measures in a speech in his state Wednesday.

During a question-and-answer session with journalist Gretchen Carlson after her speech, Whitmer empathized with the many Democrats who don’t want Democratic officials to work with Trump. But she said she needs to be collaborative because “I took an oath to the people of Michigan to try to get as much done for the state.”

Whitmer also said she hadn’t “thought through” how she’d handle tariffs differently from Trump, only that they should be used as a “scalpel.”

A national Democratic strategist said, “It is a massive indictment on Whitmer and her team’s judgment to, first, not have an answer on the tariff question and then go the White House and get absolutely played by Donald Trump to the point she is caught in the Oval Office as he signs one of his revenge and retribution executive orders and says 2020 was rigged.”

About tariffs, her spokesperson emphasized areas of disagreement with Trump rather than ways the two overlap on the policy.

“This morning, the governor delivered a speech in Washington, D.C., about the devastating effects tariffs were having on Michiganders — from companies increasing prices and laying off workers to retirement accounts being wiped out,” Whitmer’s spokesperson said. “This afternoon, the 90-day pause was announced, and that is a step in the right direction and will provide relief to so many businesses across the state, but we remain concerned about tariffs that will hurt American auto companies.”

Whitmer and Hall were supposed to discuss with Trump federal investment at Michigan’s Selfridge Air National Guard Base, a recent devastating ice storm in the state and a plan to deal with invasive Asian carp in Lake Michigan. Whitmer’s team and her allies described the meeting as a success on those matters.

“Governor Whitmer thanks President Trump for his acknowledgements on protecting the Great Lakes from invasive carp, his work on Selfridge, and his openness to our request for help in northern Michigan,” her spokesperson said.

A Democratic official who used to work with Whitmer said her dealings with Trump show she “is very good at advocating for her state.”

“And President Trump clearly listens to what she says and what she does,” this person said. “You saw that today on tariffs, on the progress they made on Selfridge and on the other issues she brought to discuss.”

Whitmer’s day also offered some political nuance. Her visit to the Oval Office didn’t annoy just Democrats. Republicans complained that it was an unnecessary boost to a leader they have long tried to demonize in a crucial electoral battleground.

“Trump literally just f---ed Republicans in Michigan by saying Whitmer is doing an excellent job,” a Republican strategist from Michigan wrote in a text message. “I mean, WTF, she is running to replace him in 2028.”

The budding Trump-Whitmer relationship — Wednesday’s meeting was their second in less than two months — would have been unthinkable not so long ago. Trump figured prominently in the political memoir Whitmer published last year, with a long-standing feud between them accounting for a large share of the first chapter: “Don’t Let the Bullies Get You Down.”

Whitmer wrote about how Trump responded to her criticism of his leadership during the early days of the pandemic by branding her dismissively and derisively as “that woman from Michigan.” Whitmer and her team embraced the insulting sobriquet, which became a staple in progressive merchandising.

“That’s the secret to dealing with bullies: You take their weapon and make it your shield,” Whitmer wrote. “Every time Trump gave me a nickname, I made it my own.”

That history had some observers struggling with cognitive dissonance Wednesday.

“Whitmer hurt her candidacy today,” a Democratic strategist said. “She looked and sounded nervous in the Oval Office. That visual will stick. So will the image of Trump praising her as he signed executive orders targeting his critics.”

A second Democratic operative who has worked with Whitmer previously said her speech today felt like an “opening salvo” for a presidential bid.

“There’s sort of this absolutism among Democrats where you’re either all against him or you’re not against him enough, right?” this person said. “And I think if you are a Midwestern governor, there are certainly appropriate times to be for tariffs.”

This person was surprised at the pushback she got from Polis after her address, adding that criticism showed “2028 is on.” But the person was also perplexed by Whitmer’s Oval Office appearance.

“It overall seemed not great,” this person said. “The photo of her standing there in the corner looking uncomfortable. The odd banter. The whole thing didn’t make a lot of sense. Why did it happen? Whose idea was that?”

Still, this person said Whitmer, who has pledged to work across the aisle, including with Trump, to deliver results for her state, can point to tangible results from her trip to Michiganders.

But nationally, the conversation around her visit will be very different.

“Overall, hey, great visit, right?” this person continued, rattling off the local issues Whitmer went to discuss — before pivoting to the executive order spectacle. “It felt like, holy s---, what just happened?”"

6,"HONG KONG — The increasingly vicious trade war between Washington and Beijing took another turn Wednesday when China imposed an additional 50% tariff on imports from the U.S., hiking its levies on American imports to 84%.

The tit-for-tat escalation came hours after President Donald Trump’s 104% tariffs on Chinese imports went into effect, including 50% Trump added Monday. Later Wednesday, Trump increased the overall U.S. tariff on Chinese goods to 125%, even as he paused higher targeted tariffs on other countries for 90 days while keeping a 10% baseline tariff in place for all countries.

Trump’s 50% tariff is a “mistake upon another mistake,” China’s Customs Tariff Commission said in a statement earlier Wednesday, adding that the world’s two biggest economies should “resolve differences through equal dialogue based on mutual respect.”

The effect of China’s 84% tariff may be somewhat limited because China imports only about $160 billion a year in U.S. goods compared with the more than $400 billion in goods it exports to the U.S.

“I don’t think they can match in the economic realm, because the relationship is so unbalanced,” said Rick Waters, the Singapore-based director of the Carnegie China think tank. “So what they tend to do is move into adjacent realms to exact a price.”

Here's a look at some of the other measures China might take.

U.S. agricultural products and poultry

China could greatly increase tariffs on U.S. agricultural products, or even stop importing them completely.

“I think there’s a very high chance that China will stop agricultural imports from the U.S. altogether,” said Tianchen Xu, a Beijing-based economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit, a financial forecasting service.

“It’s a weapon targeting Trump’s supporter base,” he added.

Soybeans, which are crushed to make protein-rich animal feed ingredients and vegetable oils, have been at the heart of the U.S.-China trade dispute for some time.

U.S. exports of soybeans to China fell 75% after China imposed a retaliatory 25% tariff on them in 2018, during Trump’s first-term trade war with Beijing.

The Trump administration announced $12 billion in subsidies for farmers to offset the impact, and it has again promised to step in if the latest round of tariffs hurts the industry further.

China could also put further restrictions on American poultry products, having announced an import ban on two U.S. companies last week.

Hollywood movies

China, which frequently trades places with North America as the world’s largest box office, is a crucial market for Hollywood films. Though China has an annual quota for the number of foreign movies that can appear in its theaters, it could ban Hollywood films altogether.

American movies have already been declining in popularity in recent years as U.S.-China trade tensions have escalated. There were no Hollywood films among China’s 10 highest-grossing movies in 2023, in stark contrast to 2012, when seven of the top 10 highest-grossing movies were U.S.-made, according to Maoyan, a Chinese movie-ticketing and data platform.

U.S. services sector and intellectual property

The U.S. has a large trade deficit with China in goods, but it comes out ahead when it comes to services such as finance, consulting and law.

U.S. data lists China as its fifth-largest export market for services, according to a report by China’s State Council released Wednesday.

China could target the U.S. services sector, for example, by excluding American companies from government procurement processes or restricting their cooperation with Chinese firms.

The U.S. has long accused China of stealing its intellectual property. But Beijing also has its own growing intellectual property interests, and it could investigate U.S. companies in China in an effort to protect them.

Fentanyl cooperation

China and the U.S. have made progress on stemming the international flow of precursor ingredients for fentanyl, some of which originate in China and are then processed into the deadly opioid in countries such as Mexico before being smuggled into the U.S.

But China could bring that cooperation to a halt in response to Trump’s tariffs.

“Out of humanitarian considerations, China has provided various forms of assistance to the U.S.,” Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said last month. “The U.S. should not repay goodwill with hostility.”

Waters said it would be “counterproductive” for China to suspend cooperation on fentanyl.

“It’s just going to cement narratives in the U.S. that they’re weaponizing drugs against us,” he said."

154,"President Donald Trump said Wednesday he was pausing higher targeted tariffs for 90 days for most countries, a stunning reversal in his trade war that has sent markets reeling.

Trump wrote on social media just before 1:30 p.m. that he came to the decision because more than 75 trading partners didn’t retaliate and have reached out to the United States to “discuss” some of the issues he had raised.

The pause didn’t apply to China, which has retaliated — with 84% hikes. Trump instead raised duties for it to 125%, effective immediately.

“Based on the lack of respect that China has shown to the World’s Markets, I am hereby raising the Tariff charged to China by the United States of America to 125%, effective immediately,” he wrote. “At some point, hopefully in the near future, China will realize that the days of ripping off the U.S.A., and other Countries, is no longer sustainable or acceptable.”

But the trade war isn’t exactly over, and the pause didn’t return the world to the time before Trump touched off the global instability; a 10% across-the-board duty will remain. For Canada and Mexico, goods covered by the U.S., Canada and Mexico trade agreement will continue to have no tariffs, while products that aren't exempt under the trade deal will have a 25% tariff. Canadian energy and fertilizer products will have a 10% tariff.

It wasn’t immediately clear which countries the pause would cover; the White House wouldn’t say. Earlier Wednesday, the European Union voted to impose fresh retaliatory duties, but they aren’t set to take effect until next week.

And separate tariffs on imported autos, steel and aluminum will remain, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said later — while planned tariffs on items like lumber and pharmaceuticals are still on.

It’s not clear what prompted Trump to change his mind — he appeared to dig in just hours earlier, telling Americans “BE COOL” in a Truth Social post, and he suggested not that long ago that the tariffs could be permanent.

“I did a 90-day pause for the people that didn’t retaliate, because I told them, ‘If you retaliate, we’re going to double it,’” Trump said Wednesday. “And that’s what I did with China, because they did retaliate. So we’ll see how it all works out. I think it’s going to work out amazing.”

But markets have been in stunning turmoil — major stock indexes shed trillions of dollars in value, while alarming signals from the bond market set Wall Street on edge.

When a false-at-the-time headline suggesting Trump would take a 90-day pause shot around the internet Monday, markets briefly surged. And a growing chorus of business leaders and Trump’s allies have come out publicly against the tariffs, including Tesla CEO Elon Musk.

Markets soared on the surprising news Wednesday, with the S&P 500 climbing more than 9%, the tech-heavy Nasdaq closing up more than 12% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average ending nearly 3,000 points higher. Among the big gainers: Tesla stock was up 22%. Despite the gains, all three indexes were down from where they were a month ago and at the start of the year, and some investors questioned what the recent volatility could mean for the U.S. stock market longer-term.

""My portfolio of defensive stocks is green so I don’t begrudge today’s market. But I ask you, would you want to own highly volatile US stocks whose price depends on whether POTUS had a good night’s sleep and woke up the next morning to reverse yesterday’s policies?"" billionaire investor Bill Gross said on X.

Goldman Sachs lowered its odds of a recession but said it is still forecasting minimal economic growth and a 45% probability of a recession given the remaining tariffs.

Borrowing costs — which had surged early Wednesday as the tariffs took effect — also eased slightly, though not substantially, as some investors may fear a lingering fallout.

Trump has been talking about tariffs as the solution for U.S. economic problems since before he became president; he branded April 2 — when he unveiled the plan — “Liberation Day,” saying it would end decades of the country’s being “looted, pillaged, raped and plundered” by other countries.

The global markets recoiled, and last week $6.6 trillion alone was wiped out. Yet Trump and his allies had doubled down until Wednesday, arguing tariffs were necessary to return manufacturing to the United States and fill the nation’s coffers with trillions of dollars in revenue that could be used to pay down debt or offset tax cuts.

It’s not clear how the White House expects the policies to fuel big gains now. With the lower 10% tariff rate left in place, there will be less incentive for companies to relocate production to the United States and less revenue being generated.

After the news, Bessent sought to make the about-face into a negotiating tactic, insisting it was a way to scare countries to come to the negotiating table by demonstrating how high the United States was going to go.

“President Trump created maximum negotiating leverage for himself,” he said.

It’s unclear how successful the United States will be at negotiating new trade agreements with other countries given Trump’s on-again, off-again threats over the past several months. Previously, he had threatened sweeping tariffs on all imports from Mexico and Canada before he walked most of them back.

And while markets surged higher Wednesday following Trump’s pause, economic uncertainty remains over what will come next in the U.S. trade war with China, which exports more than $400 billion worth of goods to the United States each year.

Under Trump’s new tariffs, the cost for U.S. companies importing goods from China has more than doubled. Those products include everything from toys and sneakers to televisions and iPhones.

U.S. companies exporting their products to China are also caught up in the fray after China increased its tariffs on American goods like agriculture products and machinery. But the White House is downplaying that risk.

“What I am certain of is that what China is doing will affect their economy much more than ours because they have an export-driven, flood-the-world-with-cheap-exports model,” Bessent said.

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said on X that he sat with Trump as he posted the initial message, adding: “The world is ready to work with President Trump to fix global trade, and China has chosen the opposite direction.”

The Trump administration will now face the daunting task of trying to negotiate dozens of potentially complex and intricate trade deals in a three-month period.

""That is a huge task to negotiate simultaneously with that many trading partners over that many issues,” said Greta Peisch, who was general counsel for the U.S. trade representative’s office during the Biden administration. “We have tariffs, non-tariff barriers, other non-trade related matters, all of those issues can get quite complicated quite quickly. Even with just a handful of trading partners, that would be a large undertaking."""

48,"Gretchen Whitmer became governor after promising to “fix the damn roads” in Michigan.

Whether she goes any further depends on how well she can navigate some of the early bumps surfacing as she positions herself for a possible White House bid.

On Wednesday, during a trip to Washington, D.C., that put a spotlight on her prospects in 2028, Whitmer hit what many of her fellow Democrats saw as two sizable potholes.

First, in a policy speech outlining a “consistent national strategy,” Whitmer staked out common ground with President Donald Trump. And though Whitmer criticized Trump’s sweeping, roller-coaster rollout of — and subsequent retreat from — tariffs, she said she was not against tariffs “outright” and expressed understanding of Trump’s “motivation” behind deploying them. That drew a social media rebuke from Colorado’s Democratic governor, Jared Polis.

“Tariffs are bad outright because they lead to higher prices and destroy American manufacturing,” Polis, another potential 2028 contender who has also sought ways to find common cause with Trump, wrote on X. “Trade is inherently good because both parties emerge better off from a consensual transaction.”

Then, later Wednesday, Whitmer joined Trump in the Oval Office. She was scheduled to meet privately with him and discuss Michigan issues. That wasn’t how it ultimately played out.

Instead, she stood by as he signed several executive orders, including two calling for Justice Department probes of officials who served in his first administration and called him out for falsely claiming the 2020 election was stolen. He made the false claims about the election’s being “rigged” again Wednesday.

Whitmer was invited into the Oval Office alongside Michigan state House Speaker Matt Hall, a Republican, as Trump held court with reporters and signed the executive orders. Photos showed Whitmer standing uncomfortably against a door as the cameras rolled.

“She’s really done an excellent job,” Trump said of Whitmer during the impromptu media availability. “Very good person.”

Though Trump did engage with her on issues she came to discuss, the fact that she was present at what amounted to a bipartisan photo opportunity as he took actions targeting political critics angered and confused allies.

“Just a f---ing disaster,” said a Democratic operative who admires Whitmer and, like others interviewed for this article, was granted anonymity to share candid thoughts about her day. “It feels like it removes some of the momentum she had as a politically savvy swing-state Dem.”

Whitmer’s team moved quickly to contain the fallout and counter mounting criticism from within her party.

“The governor was surprised that she was brought into the Oval Office during President Trump’s press conference without any notice of the subject matter,” a Whitmer spokesperson said in a statement. “Her presence is not an endorsement of the actions taken or statements made at that event.”

Democrats have long seen Whitmer as one of the party’s more formidable figures — a two-term governor of a battleground state who won re-election in a landslide and was nearly tapped to be Joe Biden’s running mate in 2020 after having considerably raised her public profile during the Covid pandemic. Whitmer is among a handful of prominent Democratic governors viewed as potential presidential contenders in 2028.

But unlike some of her contemporaries, Whitmer has chosen to seek out a stronger working relationship with Trump in his second term. Trump won her state last fall, and Whitmer views herself as more of a center-left moderate with a middle-of-the-road, Midwestern constituency — one that is receptive to Trump’s message, including and especially on manufacturing and tariff policy.

In her Washington speech Wednesday, Whitmer called for cutting red tape and building more in the United States. She also railed against “partisanship,” saying it has seemingly “infected every aspect of our lives, and it’s exhausting.”

“Let’s give more hard-working people a fair shot at a decent life,” she said. “And let’s usher in, as President Trump says, a ‘Golden Age’ of American manufacturing.”

She did break with Trump on the more substantial tariffs he announced last week and partially paused later Wednesday afternoon, describing them as a “triple whammy: higher costs, fewer jobs and more uncertainty.”

“I understand the motivation behind the tariffs, and I can tell you here’s where President Trump and I do agree,” she said. “We do need to make more stuff in America — more cars and chips, more steel and ships. We do need fair trade.”

Her stance on tariffs puts her at odds with other potential Democratic presidential hopefuls, like Polis and Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, who offered sharp criticism of Trump’s “wrongheaded” measures in a speech in his state Wednesday.

During a question-and-answer session with journalist Gretchen Carlson after her speech, Whitmer empathized with the many Democrats who don’t want Democratic officials to work with Trump. But she said she needs to be collaborative because “I took an oath to the people of Michigan to try to get as much done for the state.”

The budding Trump-Whitmer relationship — Wednesday’s meeting was their second in less than two months — would have been unthinkable not so long ago. Trump figured prominently in the political memoir Whitmer published last year, with a long-standing feud between them accounting for a large share of the first chapter: “Don’t Let the Bullies Get You Down.”

Whitmer wrote about how Trump responded to her criticism of his leadership during the early days of the pandemic by branding her dismissively and derisively as “that woman from Michigan.” Whitmer and her team embraced the insulting sobriquet, which became a staple in progressive merchandising.

“That’s the secret to dealing with bullies: You take their weapon and make it your shield,” Whitmer wrote. “Every time Trump gave me a nickname, I made it my own.”

That history had some observers struggling with cognitive dissonance Wednesday.

“Whitmer hurt her candidacy today,” a Democratic strategist said. “She looked and sounded nervous in the Oval Office. That visual will stick. So will the image of Trump praising her as he signed executive orders targeting his critics.”

China could greatly increase tariffs on U.S. agricultural products, or even stop importing them completely.

“I think there’s a very high chance that China will stop agricultural imports from the U.S. altogether,” said Tianchen Xu, a Beijing-based economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit, a financial forecasting service.

“It’s a weapon targeting Trump’s supporter base,” he added.

Soybeans, which are crushed to make protein-rich animal feed ingredients and vegetable oils, have been at the heart of the U.S.-China trade dispute for some time.

U.S. exports of soybeans to China fell 75% after China imposed a retaliatory 25% tariff on them in 2018, during Trump’s first-term trade war with Beijing.

The Trump administration announced $12 billion in subsidies for farmers to offset the impact, and it has again promised to step in if the latest round of tariffs hurts the industry further.

China could also put further restrictions on American poultry products, having announced an import ban on two U.S. companies last week.

Hollywood movies

China, which frequently trades places with North America as the world’s largest box office, is a crucial market for Hollywood films. Though China has an annual quota for the number of foreign movies that can appear in its theaters, it could ban Hollywood films altogether.

American movies have already been declining in popularity in recent years as U.S.-China trade tensions have escalated. There were no Hollywood films among China’s 10 highest-grossing movies in 2023, in stark contrast to 2012, when seven of the top 10 highest-grossing movies were U.S.-made, according to Maoyan, a Chinese movie-ticketing and data platform.

U.S. services sector and intellectual property

The U.S. has a large trade deficit with China in goods, but it comes out ahead when it comes to services such as finance, consulting and law.

U.S. data lists China as its fifth-largest export market for services, according to a report by China’s State Council released Wednesday.

China could target the U.S. services sector, for example, by excluding American companies from government procurement processes or restricting their cooperation with Chinese firms.

The U.S. has long accused China of stealing its intellectual property. But Beijing also has its own growing intellectual property interests, and it could investigate U.S. companies in China in an effort to protect them.

Fentanyl cooperation

China and the U.S. have made progress on stemming the international flow of precursor ingredients for fentanyl, some of which originate in China and are then processed into the deadly opioid in countries such as Mexico before being smuggled into the U.S.

But China could bring that cooperation to a halt in response to Trump’s tariffs.

“Out of humanitarian considerations, China has provided various forms of assistance to the U.S.,” Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said last month. “The U.S. should not repay goodwill with hostility.”

Waters said it would be “counterproductive” for China to suspend cooperation on fentanyl.

“It’s just going to cement narratives in the U.S. that they’re weaponizing drugs against us,” he said."

5,"President Donald Trump said Wednesday he was pausing higher targeted tariffs for 90 days for most countries, a stunning reversal in his trade war that has sent markets reeling.

Trump wrote on social media just before 1:30 p.m. that he came to the decision because more than 75 trading partners didn’t retaliate and have reached out to the United States to “discuss” some of the issues he had raised.

The pause didn’t apply to China, which has retaliated — with 84% hikes. Trump instead raised duties for it to 125%, effective immediately.

“Based on the lack of respect that China has shown to the World’s Markets, I am hereby raising the Tariff charged to China by the United States of America to 125%, effective immediately,” he wrote. “At some point, hopefully in the near future, China will realize that the days of ripping off the U.S.A., and other Countries, is no longer sustainable or acceptable.”

But the trade war isn’t exactly over, and the pause didn’t return the world to the time before Trump touched off the global instability; a 10% across-the-board duty will remain. For Canada and Mexico, goods covered by the U.S., Canada and Mexico trade agreement will continue to have no tariffs, while products that aren't exempt under the trade deal will have a 25% tariff. Canadian energy and fertilizer products will have a 10% tariff.

It wasn’t immediately clear which countries the pause would cover; the White House wouldn’t say. Earlier Wednesday, the European Union voted to impose fresh retaliatory duties, but they aren’t set to take effect until next week.

And separate tariffs on imported autos, steel and aluminum will remain, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said later — while planned tariffs on items like lumber and pharmaceuticals are still on.

It’s not clear what prompted Trump to change his mind — he appeared to dig in just hours earlier, telling Americans “BE COOL” in a Truth Social post, and he suggested not that long ago that the tariffs could be permanent.

“I did a 90-day pause for the people that didn’t retaliate, because I told them, ‘If you retaliate, we’re going to double it,’” Trump said Wednesday. “And that’s what I did with China, because they did retaliate. So we’ll see how it all works out. I think it’s going to work out amazing.”

But markets have been in stunning turmoil — major stock indexes shed trillions of dollars in value, while alarming signals from the bond market set Wall Street on edge.

When a false-at-the-time headline suggesting Trump would take a 90-day pause shot around the internet Monday, markets briefly surged. And a growing chorus of business leaders and Trump’s allies have come out publicly against the tariffs, including Tesla CEO Elon Musk.

Markets soared on the surprising news Wednesday, with the S&P 500 climbing more than 9%, the tech-heavy Nasdaq closing up more than 12% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average ending nearly 3,000 points higher. Among the big gainers: Tesla stock was up 22%. Despite the gains, all three indexes were down from where they were a month ago and at the start of the year, and some investors questioned what the recent volatility could mean for the U.S. stock market longer-term.

""My portfolio of defensive stocks is green so I don’t begrudge today’s market. But I ask you, would you want to own highly volatile US stocks whose price depends on whether POTUS had a good night’s sleep and woke up the next morning to reverse yesterday’s policies?"" billionaire investor Bill Gross said on X.

Goldman Sachs lowered its odds of a recession but said it is still forecasting minimal economic growth and a 45% probability of a recession given the remaining tariffs.

Borrowing costs — which had surged early Wednesday as the tariffs took effect — also eased slightly, though not substantially, as some investors may fear a lingering fallout.

Trump has been talking about tariffs as the solution for U.S. economic problems since before he became president; he branded April 2 — when he unveiled the plan — “Liberation Day,” saying it would end decades of the country’s being “looted, pillaged, raped and plundered” by other countries.

The global markets recoiled, and last week $6.6 trillion alone was wiped out. Yet Trump and his allies had doubled down until Wednesday, arguing tariffs were necessary to return manufacturing to the United States and fill the nation’s coffers with trillions of dollars in revenue that could be used to pay down debt or offset tax cuts.

It’s not clear how the White House expects the policies to fuel big gains now. With the lower 10% tariff rate left in place, there will be less incentive for companies to relocate production to the United States and less revenue being generated.

After the news, Bessent sought to make the about-face into a negotiating tactic, insisting it was a way to scare countries to come to the negotiating table by demonstrating how high the United States was going to go.

“President Trump created maximum negotiating leverage for himself,” he said.

It’s unclear how successful the United States will be at negotiating new trade agreements with other countries given Trump’s on-again, off-again threats over the past several months. Previously, he had threatened sweeping tariffs on all imports from Mexico and Canada before he walked most of them back.

And while markets surged higher Wednesday following Trump’s pause, economic uncertainty remains over what will come next in the U.S. trade war with China, which exports more than $400 billion worth of goods to the United States each year.

Under Trump’s new tariffs, the cost for U.S. companies importing goods from China has more than doubled. Those products include everything from toys and sneakers to televisions and iPhones.

U.S. companies exporting their products to China are also caught up in the fray after China increased its tariffs on American goods like agriculture products and machinery. But the White House is downplaying that risk.

“What I am certain of is that what China is doing will affect their economy much more than ours because they have an export-driven, flood-the-world-with-cheap-exports model,” Bessent said.

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said on X that he sat with Trump as he posted the initial message, adding: “The world is ready to work with President Trump to fix global trade, and China has chosen the opposite direction.”

The Trump administration will now face the daunting task of trying to negotiate dozens of potentially complex and intricate trade deals in a three-month period.

""That is a huge task to negotiate simultaneously with that many trading partners over that many issues,” said Greta Peisch, who was general counsel for the U.S. trade representative’s office during the Biden administration. “We have tariffs, non-tariff barriers, other non-trade related matters, all of those issues can get quite complicated quite quickly. Even with just a handful of trading partners, that would be a large undertaking."""
0,"Gretchen Whitmer became governor after promising to “fix the damn roads” in Michigan.

Whether she goes any further depends on how well she can navigate some of the early bumps surfacing as she positions herself for a possible White House bid.

On Wednesday, during a trip to Washington, D.C., that put a spotlight on her prospects in 2028, Whitmer hit what many of her fellow Democrats saw as two sizable potholes.

First, in a policy speech outlining a “consistent national strategy,” Whitmer staked out common ground with President Donald Trump. And though Whitmer criticized Trump’s sweeping, roller-coaster rollout of — and subsequent retreat from — tariffs, she said she was not against tariffs “outright” and expressed understanding of Trump’s “motivation” behind deploying them. That drew a social media rebuke from Colorado’s Democratic governor, Jared Polis.

“Tariffs are bad outright because they lead to higher prices and destroy American manufacturing,” Polis, another potential 2028 contender who has also sought ways to find common cause with Trump, wrote on X. “Trade is inherently good because both parties emerge better off from a consensual transaction.”

Then, later Wednesday, Whitmer joined Trump in the Oval Office. She was scheduled to meet privately with him and discuss Michigan issues. That wasn’t how it ultimately played out.

Instead, she stood by as he signed several executive orders, including two calling for Justice Department probes of officials who served in his first administration and called him out for falsely claiming the 2020 election was stolen. He made the false claims about the election’s being “rigged” again Wednesday.

Whitmer was invited into the Oval Office alongside Michigan state House Speaker Matt Hall, a Republican, as Trump held court with reporters and signed the executive orders. Photos showed Whitmer standing uncomfortably against a door as the cameras rolled.

“She’s really done an excellent job,” Trump said of Whitmer during the impromptu media availability. “Very good person.”

Though Trump did engage with her on issues she came to discuss, the fact that she was present at what amounted to a bipartisan photo opportunity as he took actions targeting political critics angered and confused allies.

“Just a f---ing disaster,” said a Democratic operative who admires Whitmer and, like others interviewed for this article, was granted anonymity to share candid thoughts about her day. “It feels like it removes some of the momentum she had as a politically savvy swing-state Dem.”

Whitmer’s team moved quickly to contain the fallout and counter mounting criticism from within her party.

“The governor was surprised that she was brought into the Oval Office during President Trump’s press conference without any notice of the subject matter,” a Whitmer spokesperson said in a statement. “Her presence is not an endorsement of the actions taken or statements made at that event.”

Democrats have long seen Whitmer as one of the party’s more formidable figures — a two-term governor of a battleground state who won re-election in a landslide and was nearly tapped to be Joe Biden’s running mate in 2020 after having considerably raised her public profile during the Covid pandemic. Whitmer is among a handful of prominent Democratic governors viewed as potential presidential contenders in 2028.

But unlike some of her contemporaries, Whitmer has chosen to seek out a stronger working relationship with Trump in his second term. Trump won her state last fall, and Whitmer views herself as more of a center-left moderate with a middle-of-the-road, Midwestern constituency — one that is receptive to Trump’s message, including and especially on manufacturing and tariff policy.

In her Washington speech Wednesday, Whitmer called for cutting red tape and building more in the United States. She also railed against “partisanship,” saying it has seemingly “infected every aspect of our lives, and it’s exhausting.”

“Let’s give more hard-working people a fair shot at a decent life,” she said. “And let’s usher in, as President Trump says, a ‘Golden Age’ of American manufacturing.”

She did break with Trump on the more substantial tariffs he announced last week and partially paused later Wednesday afternoon, describing them as a “triple whammy: higher costs, fewer jobs and more uncertainty.”

“I understand the motivation behind the tariffs, and I can tell you here’s where President Trump and I do agree,” she said. “We do need to make more stuff in America — more cars and chips, more steel and ships. We do need fair trade.”

Her stance on tariffs puts her at odds with other potential Democratic presidential hopefuls, like Polis and Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, who offered sharp criticism of Trump’s “wrongheaded” measures in a speech in his state Wednesday.

During a question-and-answer session with journalist Gretchen Carlson after her speech, Whitmer empathized with the many Democrats who don’t want Democratic officials to work with Trump. But she said she needs to be collaborative because “I took an oath to the people of Michigan to try to get as much done for the state.”

Whitmer also said she hadn’t “thought through” how she’d handle tariffs differently from Trump, only that they should be used as a “scalpel.”

A national Democratic strategist said, “It is a massive indictment on Whitmer and her team’s judgment to, first, not have an answer on the tariff question and then go the White House and get absolutely played by Donald Trump to the point she is caught in the Oval Office as he signs one of his revenge and retribution executive orders and says 2020 was rigged.”

About tariffs, her spokesperson emphasized areas of disagreement with Trump rather than ways the two overlap on the policy.

“This morning, the governor delivered a speech in Washington, D.C., about the devastating effects tariffs were having on Michiganders — from companies increasing prices and laying off workers to retirement accounts being wiped out,” Whitmer’s spokesperson said. “This afternoon, the 90-day pause was announced, and that is a step in the right direction and will provide relief to so many businesses across the state, but we remain concerned about tariffs that will hurt American auto companies.”

Whitmer and Hall were supposed to discuss with Trump federal investment at Michigan’s Selfridge Air National Guard Base, a recent devastating ice storm in the state and a plan to deal with invasive Asian carp in Lake Michigan. Whitmer’s team and her allies described the meeting as a success on those matters.

“Governor Whitmer thanks President Trump for his acknowledgements on protecting the Great Lakes from invasive carp, his work on Selfridge, and his openness to our request for help in northern Michigan,” her spokesperson said.

A Democratic official who used to work with Whitmer said her dealings with Trump show she “is very good at advocating for her state.”

“And President Trump clearly listens to what she says and what she does,” this person said. “You saw that today on tariffs, on the progress they made on Selfridge and on the other issues she brought to discuss.”

Whitmer’s day also offered some political nuance. Her visit to the Oval Office didn’t annoy just Democrats. Republicans complained that it was an unnecessary boost to a leader they have long tried to demonize in a crucial electoral battleground.

“Trump literally just f---ed Republicans in Michigan by saying Whitmer is doing an excellent job,” a Republican strategist from Michigan wrote in a text message. “I mean, WTF, she is running to replace him in 2028.”

The budding Trump-Whitmer relationship — Wednesday’s meeting was their second in less than two months — would have been unthinkable not so long ago. Trump figured prominently in the political memoir Whitmer published last year, with a long-standing feud between them accounting for a large share of the first chapter: “Don’t Let the Bullies Get You Down.”

Whitmer wrote about how Trump responded to her criticism of his leadership during the early days of the pandemic by branding her dismissively and derisively as “that woman from Michigan.” Whitmer and her team embraced the insulting sobriquet, which became a staple in progressive merchandising.

“That’s the secret to dealing with bullies: You take their weapon and make it your shield,” Whitmer wrote. “Every time Trump gave me a nickname, I made it my own.”

That history had some observers struggling with cognitive dissonance Wednesday.

“Whitmer hurt her candidacy today,” a Democratic strategist said. “She looked and sounded nervous in the Oval Office. That visual will stick. So will the image of Trump praising her as he signed executive orders targeting his critics.”

A second Democratic operative who has worked with Whitmer previously said her speech today felt like an “opening salvo” for a presidential bid.

“There’s sort of this absolutism among Democrats where you’re either all against him or you’re not against him enough, right?” this person said. “And I think if you are a Midwestern governor, there are certainly appropriate times to be for tariffs.”

This person was surprised at the pushback she got from Polis after her address, adding that criticism showed “2028 is on.” But the person was also perplexed by Whitmer’s Oval Office appearance.

“It overall seemed not great,” this person said. “The photo of her standing there in the corner looking uncomfortable. The odd banter. The whole thing didn’t make a lot of sense. Why did it happen? Whose idea was that?”

Still, this person said Whitmer, who has pledged to work across the aisle, including with Trump, to deliver results for her state, can point to tangible results from her trip to Michiganders.

But nationally, the conversation around her visit will be very different.

“Overall, hey, great visit, right?” this person continued, rattling off the local issues Whitmer went to discuss — before pivoting to the executive order spectacle. “It felt like, holy s---, what just happened?”"

47,"HONG KONG — The increasingly vicious trade war between Washington and Beijing took another turn Wednesday when China imposed an additional 50% tariff on imports from the U.S., hiking its levies on American imports to 84%.

The tit-for-tat escalation came hours after President Donald Trump’s 104% tariffs on Chinese imports went into effect, including 50% Trump added Monday. Later Wednesday, Trump increased the overall U.S. tariff on Chinese goods to 125%, even as he paused higher targeted tariffs on other countries for 90 days while keeping a 10% baseline tariff in place for all countries.

Trump’s 50% tariff is a “mistake upon another mistake,” China’s Customs Tariff Commission said in a statement earlier Wednesday, adding that the world’s two biggest economies should “resolve differences through equal dialogue based on mutual respect.”

The effect of China’s 84% tariff may be somewhat limited because China imports only about $160 billion a year in U.S. goods compared with the more than $400 billion in goods it exports to the U.S.

“I don’t think they can match in the economic realm, because the relationship is so unbalanced,” said Rick Waters, the Singapore-based director of the Carnegie China think tank. “So what they tend to do is move into adjacent realms to exact a price.”

Here's a look at some of the other measures China might take.

U.S. agricultural products and poultry

China could greatly increase tariffs on U.S. agricultural products, or even stop importing them completely.

“I think there’s a very high chance that China will stop agricultural imports from the U.S. altogether,” said Tianchen Xu, a Beijing-based economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit, a financial forecasting service.

“It’s a weapon targeting Trump’s supporter base,” he added.

Soybeans, which are crushed to make protein-rich animal feed ingredients and vegetable oils, have been at the heart of the U.S.-China trade dispute for some time.

U.S. exports of soybeans to China fell 75% after China imposed a retaliatory 25% tariff on them in 2018, during Trump’s first-term trade war with Beijing.

The Trump administration announced $12 billion in subsidies for farmers to offset the impact, and it has again promised to step in if the latest round of tariffs hurts the industry further.

China could also put further restrictions on American poultry products, having announced an import ban on two U.S. companies last week.

Hollywood movies

China, which frequently trades places with North America as the world’s largest box office, is a crucial market for Hollywood films. Though China has an annual quota for the number of foreign movies that can appear in its theaters, it could ban Hollywood films altogether.

American movies have already been declining in popularity in recent years as U.S.-China trade tensions have escalated. There were no Hollywood films among China’s 10 highest-grossing movies in 2023, in stark contrast to 2012, when seven of the top 10 highest-grossing movies were U.S.-made, according to Maoyan, a Chinese movie-ticketing and data platform.

U.S. services sector and intellectual property

The U.S. has a large trade deficit with China in goods, but it comes out ahead when it comes to services such as finance, consulting and law.

U.S. data lists China as its fifth-largest export market for services, according to a report by China’s State Council released Wednesday.

China could target the U.S. services sector, for example, by excluding American companies from government procurement processes or restricting their cooperation with Chinese firms.

The U.S. has long accused China of stealing its intellectual property. But Beijing also has its own growing intellectual property interests, and it could investigate U.S. companies in China in an effort to protect them.

Fentanyl cooperation

China and the U.S. have made progress on stemming the international flow of precursor ingredients for fentanyl, some of which originate in China and are then processed into the deadly opioid in countries such as Mexico before being smuggled into the U.S.

But China could bring that cooperation to a halt in response to Trump’s tariffs.

“Out of humanitarian considerations, China has provided various forms of assistance to the U.S.,” Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said last month. “The U.S. should not repay goodwill with hostility.”

Waters said it would be “counterproductive” for China to suspend cooperation on fentanyl.

“It’s just going to cement narratives in the U.S. that they’re weaponizing drugs against us,” he said."

3,"In the wake of President Donald Trump’s announcement Wednesday afternoon that he was pausing country-by-country tariffs by 90 days, some experts — as well as critics of Trump and social media users — are raising questions about a statement he posted earlier in the day that may have indicated the massive sell-off in stocks in recent days was coming to an end.

Not long after trading opened at 9:30 a.m. Wednesday, Trump took to his Truth Social platform and wrote:

“BE COOL! Everything is going to work out well. The USA will be bigger and better than ever before!”

Four minutes later, he wrote:

“THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!! DJT”

Just before 1:30 p.m., Trump announced the pause, sending stocks soaring. The tech-heavy Nasdaq index had its biggest one-day gain since 2008, rising nearly 12%, while the S&P 500 climbed 9.5% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 8%, or about 2,800 points.

Trump could have been generally urging people to buy into the market while prices were relatively low. That was the response Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick gave when he was asked about the posts Wednesday evening on CNBC.

“Donald Trump understands that … America is the greatest country, all right? We are the greatest country, and we have the capacity for incredible greatness. But someone needs to take the shackles off.”

But on social media, some users raised the prospect — without evidence — of market manipulation, while others began referring to the market’s sharp turn upward as the “Trump Pump.”

There is no evidence to suggest that Trump was seeking to manipulate markets or that he or any of his advisers acted on inside information

For Richard Painter, chief ethics lawyer for former President George W. Bush, who now teaches government ethics and security regulation at the University of Minnesota’s law school, the morning posts, at a minimum, leave Trump open to questions about his intentions.

“This is a scenario that could expose the president to accusations that he engaged in market manipulation,” Painter said.

Even before he’d been sworn in for his second term, Trump faced insider-trading criticisms amid the launch of his $TRUMP meme coin. In that incident, the Trump Organization was explicit that a group of investors who were helping launch the coin stood to benefit from its release assuming its price went up. Still, reports showed other investors reaping outsized profits from the launch, including one crypto-wallet owner or owners who earned $109 million, according to a New York Times analysis.

Some Democrats were quick to blast Trump’s actions on Wednesday.

""An insider trading scandal is brewing,"" Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., posted on X.

Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., told NBC News that the Trump administration is “replete with grifters” and that “corruption is its middle name.”

“Insider trading is a real threat, and I hope there will be a surge of penetrating investigations into the potential for manipulation and insider trading of securities,” Blumenthal said, “since the knowledge of what Trump’s plans have been and may be is widely spread.”

Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif. — a frequent object of Trump’s scorn — also suggested an inquiry was warranted.

“Trump is creating giant market fluctuations with his on-again, off-again tariffs,” Schiff wrote on social media. “These constant gyrations in policy provide dangerous opportunities for insider trading. Who in the administration knew about Trump’s latest tariff flip flop ahead of time? Did anyone buy or sell stocks, and profit at the public’s expense? I’m writing to the White House — the public has a right to know.”

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., pointed to the upcoming May 15 deadline for members of Congress to submit their financial disclosure reports, writing on X, ""Any member of Congress who purchased stocks in the last 48 hours should probably disclose that now. I’ve been hearing some interesting chatter on the floor.""

A White House spokesman rejected the Democrats’ assertions.

“It is the responsibility of the President of the United States to reassure the markets and Americans about their economic security in the face of nonstop media fearmongering,” White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement. “Instead of grasping at straws to try landing a punch on President Trump, Democrats should focus on working with the administration to restore American Greatness.”

A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment. The Securities and Exchange Commission did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Painter said the incident could result in investigations “into who knew what and when before [Trump] announced he was going to postpone the tariffs on all the countries except for China.”

“This was a terrible idea to make those posts,” Painter said of Trump’s suggestion that it was “a great time to buy.”

Painter further admonished Trump, saying, “I would hope that he would focus on doing his job — and try to calm the markets and have a predictable trade policy and let the markets do their thing without the White House giving what appears to be investment advice.”"
102,"Gretchen Whitmer became governor after promising to “fix the damn roads” in Michigan.

Whether she goes any further depends on how well she can navigate some of the early bumps surfacing as she positions herself for a possible White House bid.

On Wednesday, during a trip to Washington, D.C., that put a spotlight on her prospects in 2028, Whitmer hit what many of her fellow Democrats saw as two sizable potholes.

First, in a policy speech outlining a “consistent national strategy,” Whitmer staked out common ground with President Donald Trump. And though Whitmer criticized Trump’s sweeping, roller-coaster rollout of — and subsequent retreat from — tariffs, she said she was not against tariffs “outright” and expressed understanding of Trump’s “motivation” behind deploying them. That drew a social media rebuke from Colorado’s Democratic governor, Jared Polis.

“Tariffs are bad outright because they lead to higher prices and destroy American manufacturing,” Polis, another potential 2028 contender who has also sought ways to find common cause with Trump, wrote on X. “Trade is inherently good because both parties emerge better off from a consensual transaction.”

Then, later Wednesday, Whitmer joined Trump in the Oval Office. She was scheduled to meet privately with him and discuss Michigan issues. That wasn’t how it ultimately played out.

Instead, she stood by as he signed several executive orders, including two calling for Justice Department probes of officials who served in his first administration and called him out for falsely claiming the 2020 election was stolen. He made the false claims about the election’s being “rigged” again Wednesday.

Whitmer was invited into the Oval Office alongside Michigan state House Speaker Matt Hall, a Republican, as Trump held court with reporters and signed the executive orders. Photos showed Whitmer standing uncomfortably against a door as the cameras rolled.

“She’s really done an excellent job,” Trump said of Whitmer during the impromptu media availability. “Very good person.”

Though Trump did engage with her on issues she came to discuss, the fact that she was present at what amounted to a bipartisan photo opportunity as he took actions targeting political critics angered and confused allies.

“Just a f---ing disaster,” said a Democratic operative who admires Whitmer and, like others interviewed for this article, was granted anonymity to share candid thoughts about her day. “It feels like it removes some of the momentum she had as a politically savvy swing-state Dem.”

Whitmer’s team moved quickly to contain the fallout and counter mounting criticism from within her party.

“The governor was surprised that she was brought into the Oval Office during President Trump’s press conference without any notice of the subject matter,” a Whitmer spokesperson said in a statement. “Her presence is not an endorsement of the actions taken or statements made at that event.”

Democrats have long seen Whitmer as one of the party’s more formidable figures — a two-term governor of a battleground state who won re-election in a landslide and was nearly tapped to be Joe Biden’s running mate in 2020 after having considerably raised her public profile during the Covid pandemic. Whitmer is among a handful of prominent Democratic governors viewed as potential presidential contenders in 2028.

But unlike some of her contemporaries, Whitmer has chosen to seek out a stronger working relationship with Trump in his second term. Trump won her state last fall, and Whitmer views herself as more of a center-left moderate with a middle-of-the-road, Midwestern constituency — one that is receptive to Trump’s message, including and especially on manufacturing and tariff policy.

In her Washington speech Wednesday, Whitmer called for cutting red tape and building more in the United States. She also railed against “partisanship,” saying it has seemingly “infected every aspect of our lives, and it’s exhausting.”

“Let’s give more hard-working people a fair shot at a decent life,” she said. “And let’s usher in, as President Trump says, a ‘Golden Age’ of American manufacturing.”

She did break with Trump on the more substantial tariffs he announced last week and partially paused later Wednesday afternoon, describing them as a “triple whammy: higher costs, fewer jobs and more uncertainty.”

“I understand the motivation behind the tariffs, and I can tell you here’s where President Trump and I do agree,” she said. “We do need to make more stuff in America — more cars and chips, more steel and ships. We do need fair trade.”

Her stance on tariffs puts her at odds with other potential Democratic presidential hopefuls, like Polis and Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, who offered sharp criticism of Trump’s “wrongheaded” measures in a speech in his state Wednesday.

During a question-and-answer session with journalist Gretchen Carlson after her speech, Whitmer empathized with the many Democrats who don’t want Democratic officials to work with Trump. But she said she needs to be collaborative because “I took an oath to the people of Michigan to try to get as much done for the state.”

Whitmer also said she hadn’t “thought through” how she’d handle tariffs differently from Trump, only that they should be used as a “scalpel.”

A national Democratic strategist said, “It is a massive indictment on Whitmer and her team’s judgment to, first, not have an answer on the tariff question and then go the White House and get absolutely played by Donald Trump to the point she is caught in the Oval Office as he signs one of his revenge and retribution executive orders and says 2020 was rigged.”

About tariffs, her spokesperson emphasized areas of disagreement with Trump rather than ways the two overlap on the policy.

“This morning, the governor delivered a speech in Washington, D.C., about the devastating effects tariffs were having on Michiganders — from companies increasing prices and laying off workers to retirement accounts being wiped out,” Whitmer’s spokesperson said. “This afternoon, the 90-day pause was announced, and that is a step in the right direction and will provide relief to so many businesses across the state, but we remain concerned about tariffs that will hurt American auto companies.”

Whitmer and Hall were supposed to discuss with Trump federal investment at Michigan’s Selfridge Air National Guard Base, a recent devastating ice storm in the state and a plan to deal with invasive Asian carp in Lake Michigan. Whitmer’s team and her allies described the meeting as a success on those matters.

“Governor Whitmer thanks President Trump for his acknowledgements on protecting the Great Lakes from invasive carp, his work on Selfridge, and his openness to our request for help in northern Michigan,” her spokesperson said.

A Democratic official who used to work with Whitmer said her dealings with Trump show she “is very good at advocating for her state.”

“And President Trump clearly listens to what she says and what she does,” this person said. “You saw that today on tariffs, on the progress they made on Selfridge and on the other issues she brought to discuss.”

Whitmer’s day also offered some political nuance. Her visit to the Oval Office didn’t annoy just Democrats. Republicans complained that it was an unnecessary boost to a leader they have long tried to demonize in a crucial electoral battleground.

“Trump literally just f---ed Republicans in Michigan by saying Whitmer is doing an excellent job,” a Republican strategist from Michigan wrote in a text message. “I mean, WTF, she is running to replace him in 2028.”

The budding Trump-Whitmer relationship — Wednesday’s meeting was their second in less than two months — would have been unthinkable not so long ago. Trump figured prominently in the political memoir Whitmer published last year, with a long-standing feud between them accounting for a large share of the first chapter: “Don’t Let the Bullies Get You Down.”

Whitmer wrote about how Trump responded to her criticism of his leadership during the early days of the pandemic by branding her dismissively and derisively as “that woman from Michigan.” Whitmer and her team embraced the insulting sobriquet, which became a staple in progressive merchandising.

“That’s the secret to dealing with bullies: You take their weapon and make it your shield,” Whitmer wrote. “Every time Trump gave me a nickname, I made it my own.”

That history had some observers struggling with cognitive dissonance Wednesday.

“Whitmer hurt her candidacy today,” a Democratic strategist said. “She looked and sounded nervous in the Oval Office. That visual will stick. So will the image of Trump praising her as he signed executive orders targeting his critics.”

A second Democratic operative who has worked with Whitmer previously said her speech today felt like an “opening salvo” for a presidential bid.

“There’s sort of this absolutism among Democrats where you’re either all against him or you’re not against him enough, right?” this person said. “And I think if you are a Midwestern governor, there are certainly appropriate times to be for tariffs.”

This person was surprised at the pushback she got from Polis after her address, adding that criticism showed “2028 is on.” But the person was also perplexed by Whitmer’s Oval Office appearance.

“It overall seemed not great,” this person said. “The photo of her standing there in the corner looking uncomfortable. The odd banter. The whole thing didn’t make a lot of sense. Why did it happen? Whose idea was that?”

Still, this person said Whitmer, who has pledged to work across the aisle, including with Trump, to deliver results for her state, can point to tangible results from her trip to Michiganders.

But nationally, the conversation around her visit will be very different.

“Overall, hey, great visit, right?” this person continued, rattling off the local issues Whitmer went to discuss — before pivoting to the executive order spectacle. “It felt like, holy s---, what just happened?”"
100,"President Donald Trump said Wednesday he was pausing higher targeted tariffs for 90 days for most countries, a stunning reversal in his trade war that has sent markets reeling.

Trump wrote on social media just before 1:30 p.m. that he came to the decision because more than 75 trading partners didn’t retaliate and have reached out to the United States to “discuss” some of the issues he had raised.

The pause didn’t apply to China, which has retaliated — with 84% hikes. Trump instead raised duties for it to 125%, effective immediately.

“Based on the lack of respect that China has shown to the World’s Markets, I am hereby raising the Tariff charged to China by the United States of America to 125%, effective immediately,” he wrote. “At some point, hopefully in the near future, China will realize that the days of ripping off the U.S.A., and other Countries, is no longer sustainable or acceptable.”

But the trade war isn’t exactly over, and the pause didn’t return the world to the time before Trump touched off the global instability; a 10% across-the-board duty will remain. For Canada and Mexico, goods covered by the U.S., Canada and Mexico trade agreement will continue to have no tariffs, while products that aren't exempt under the trade deal will have a 25% tariff. Canadian energy and fertilizer products will have a 10% tariff.

It wasn’t immediately clear which countries the pause would cover; the White House wouldn’t say. Earlier Wednesday, the European Union voted to impose fresh retaliatory duties, but they aren’t set to take effect until next week.

And separate tariffs on imported autos, steel and aluminum will remain, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said later — while planned tariffs on items like lumber and pharmaceuticals are still on.

It’s not clear what prompted Trump to change his mind — he appeared to dig in just hours earlier, telling Americans “BE COOL” in a Truth Social post, and he suggested not that long ago that the tariffs could be permanent.

“I did a 90-day pause for the people that didn’t retaliate, because I told them, ‘If you retaliate, we’re going to double it,’” Trump said Wednesday. “And that’s what I did with China, because they did retaliate. So we’ll see how it all works out. I think it’s going to work out amazing.”

But markets have been in stunning turmoil — major stock indexes shed trillions of dollars in value, while alarming signals from the bond market set Wall Street on edge.

When a false-at-the-time headline suggesting Trump would take a 90-day pause shot around the internet Monday, markets briefly surged. And a growing chorus of business leaders and Trump’s allies have come out publicly against the tariffs, including Tesla CEO Elon Musk.

Markets soared on the surprising news Wednesday, with the S&P 500 climbing more than 9%, the tech-heavy Nasdaq closing up more than 12% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average ending nearly 3,000 points higher. Among the big gainers: Tesla stock was up 22%. Despite the gains, all three indexes were down from where they were a month ago and at the start of the year, and some investors questioned what the recent volatility could mean for the U.S. stock market longer-term.

""My portfolio of defensive stocks is green so I don’t begrudge today’s market. But I ask you, would you want to own highly volatile US stocks whose price depends on whether POTUS had a good night’s sleep and woke up the next morning to reverse yesterday’s policies?"" billionaire investor Bill Gross said on X.

Goldman Sachs lowered its odds of a recession but said it is still forecasting minimal economic growth and a 45% probability of a recession given the remaining tariffs.

Borrowing costs — which had surged early Wednesday as the tariffs took effect — also eased slightly, though not substantially, as some investors may fear a lingering fallout.

Trump has been talking about tariffs as the solution for U.S. economic problems since before he became president; he branded April 2 — when he unveiled the plan — “Liberation Day,” saying it would end decades of the country’s being “looted, pillaged, raped and plundered” by other countries.

The global markets recoiled, and last week $6.6 trillion alone was wiped out. Yet Trump and his allies had doubled down until Wednesday, arguing tariffs were necessary to return manufacturing to the United States and fill the nation’s coffers with trillions of dollars in revenue that could be used to pay down debt or offset tax cuts.

It’s not clear how the White House expects the policies to fuel big gains now. With the lower 10% tariff rate left in place, there will be less incentive for companies to relocate production to the United States and less revenue being generated.

After the news, Bessent sought to make the about-face into a negotiating tactic, insisting it was a way to scare countries to come to the negotiating table by demonstrating how high the United States was going to go.

“President Trump created maximum negotiating leverage for himself,” he said.

It’s unclear how successful the United States will be at negotiating new trade agreements with other countries given Trump’s on-again, off-again threats over the past several months. Previously, he had threatened sweeping tariffs on all imports from Mexico and Canada before he walked most of them back.

And while markets surged higher Wednesday following Trump’s pause, economic uncertainty remains over what will come next in the U.S. trade war with China, which exports more than $400 billion worth of goods to the United States each year.

Under Trump’s new tariffs, the cost for U.S. companies importing goods from China has more than doubled. Those products include everything from toys and sneakers to televisions and iPhones.

U.S. companies exporting their products to China are also caught up in the fray after China increased its tariffs on American goods like agriculture products and machinery. But the White House is downplaying that risk.

“What I am certain of is that what China is doing will affect their economy much more than ours because they have an export-driven, flood-the-world-with-cheap-exports model,” Bessent said.

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said on X that he sat with Trump as he posted the initial message, adding: “The world is ready to work with President Trump to fix global trade, and China has chosen the opposite direction.”

The Trump administration will now face the daunting task of trying to negotiate dozens of potentially complex and intricate trade deals in a three-month period.

""That is a huge task to negotiate simultaneously with that many trading partners over that many issues,” said Greta Peisch, who was general counsel for the U.S. trade representative’s office during the Biden administration. “We have tariffs, non-tariff barriers, other non-trade related matters, all of those issues can get quite complicated quite quickly. Even with just a handful of trading partners, that would be a large undertaking."""
148,"As President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariff plans sent stocks tumbling and economists warning of a broader economic slowdown, many of Trump’s supporters say they support the move as part of a broader vision for the U.S. economy, even if prices rise.

But a slice of 2024 Trump voters are deeply concerned, illustrating the real potential political peril for the president and his party.

In interviews, 20 swing-state Trump voters who participated in last month’s national NBC News poll spoke about Trump and his tariffs after the president's policy announcement last week. Most are either fully on board with Trump’s vision — with many explicitly saying they are willing to live through short-term economic pain if it means achieving his vision of reordering the global economy to America’s benefit — or are cautiously optimistic that the tariffs will be effective negotiating tools.

Veronica Rogers, a retiree in Georgia, was among those who said that Trump’s long-term goals of bringing back jobs to the United States outweigh her concerns about temporary higher prices.

“Whether that’d be short term, or that’d be long term, I don’t know. I’m not an economist. But I do know that there’s billions and trillions of dollars that can be spent here to build industry to keep from paying tariffs. So, that sounds good to me,” she said. She was stunned that some people were taken aback by the scale of Trump’s tariffs, noting how frequently he talked about tariffs while campaigning.

“Nothing they’re doing is news to people that voted for him,” Rogers, 63, said.

Still, a handful of voters, including those who backed Trump in 2020 and 2024, warned that his tariff rollout threatens to squander one of his major campaign promises: to lower prices for Americans in the long term. The NBC News poll conducted in March, before Trump fully unveiled his tariff plans, found that a majority of Americans (55%) disapproved of his handling of inflation and the cost of living, while 54% disapproved of his handling of the economy overall. Members of the GOP were far more likely to give Trump passing marks on the economy than were independents and Democrats, but about 1 in 10 Republicans expressed displeasure with his handling of the key issues.

“The track he’s on right now is just to piss the Democrats off, and I think it’s kind of working, but no, I’m not really too happy with the way things are going right now. He’s really gone off the wall,” said Cathy Phillips, a 64-year-old Pennsylvanian who voted for Trump in 2020 and 2024.

“We’re scraping pennies together, I know how hard it is for us,” she continued. “I can’t imagine how hard it is for seniors who are even older than us. Something’s gotta give somewhere.”

Trusting Trump

Yet, for many of these voters, Trump’s decision to put heavy tariffs on some of America’s biggest trading partners, such as the European Union, China and Vietnam, as well as most other countries, is exactly what they signed up for.

“I feel like everything that I voted for has come to fruition already and more,” said Melanie Renaud, a 52-year-old dental hygienist from North Carolina.

Some point to local factories that shuttered and moved jobs overseas, leaving behind crumbling communities, to argue for drastic steps to bring jobs back to the U.S. Others believe some of the sky-high tariff rates are a hard-edged negotiating tactic aimed at compelling countries to make immediate concessions that will help the American economy in the long term. Others said it’s a needed response to an economy they believe wasn’t working for them.

“This trade war has to happen in order for fair trade to happen. And once fair trade is accomplished, I think prices will even back out,” said Reece Westfall, a 30-year-old Pennsylvania Republican.

“There’s a lot more to this than the price of everything,” Westfall continued, echoing recent arguments from Trump administration officials, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on NBC News’ “Meet the Press.”

Donna J., 55, who declined to give her last name, said that while her part of North Carolina had a long history of textile mills like the one in which her grandfather worked, the town “basically folded in upon itself” once that factory closed. “What you get used to, sometimes, is the very thing that will kill you,” she said of how the globalized economy has hurt communities like hers. She said Americans need to “learn some patience and understand this is for the betterment of everyone,” calling the tariffs an example of Trump’s “promises made, promises kept.”

Some criticize Trump’s moves

But other voters who backed Trump were critical of the president’s approach. David, a Wisconsin man who voted for Trump in 2020 and 2024, said the administration is “throwing spaghetti at the wall to see what sticks.” (Like some others who were critical of Trump, he declined to share his last name because of concerns about retribution or harassment.)

“I cannot see a reasonable businessperson in the near term looking at this and saying, ‘I feel confident that I can invest millions of dollars into a new production facility and create new jobs in the U.S.,” he said, later adding, “I was expecting a more reasoned and logical rollout.”

David said he voted for Trump because of the economy, believing a continuation of Biden administration policies if Kamala Harris had won the election would not have been good for the country.

But despite his hesitance about Trump’s economic policies, David said he would still vote for him if given a chance for a do-over, even if it was less than a full-throated support.

“I would like to think that there would be a better option in the future,” he added.

Another Trump voter, who declined to give his first or last name because of concerns about harassment or retaliation, said he now sees his vote for Trump as a “big mistake.” The 64-year-old Arizona man said his retirement savings have fallen 35% in recent weeks, and he may now have to delay his retirement.

“It’s happened without any reasonable explanation,” he said “I don’t understand. I don’t understand how to declare a trade war on the world, how to betray the allies, I can’t understand it.”

Seeing a potential exit strategy

Many of the Trump voters who spoke to NBC News said they didn’t believe the high tariffs would last, instead predicting that they would compel other countries to the negotiating table.

“I wouldn’t be surprised if, in the next month or two, we see a lot of these countries do bilateral negotiations,” said John, a 30-year-old from Arizona who voted for Trump in 2016 and 2024 but supported Joe Biden in 2020.

“Part of these extremely high tariffs are designed, in a sense, in my belief, as a way to get more from these countries,” he continued.

Ultimately, some of Trump’s most ardent supporters said they would be personally willing to take their lumps now, both in terms of potential rising prices and an unstable stock market, if it meant that the president's plans to reorient the global economy succeed, because they believe it will leave a better future for their children.

“I’m willing to not look at my [401k] numbers on a daily basis. I’m willing to trust President Trump that it will turn around,” said Jodi L., a 62-year-old from Michigan. “I have to do my part. I can call up and complain all I want, but I believe it’s on the right path to turning this country around. I believe in him and what he’s said he would do because he’s proven himself in less than 100 days.”

“I’m willing to take the knock if that’s what it takes for the long term.”

Sherry Behr, a 67-year-old Republican from Pennsylvania, said, “I trust President Trump, that in six months, a year, we’ll start seeing a difference.”

Most Trump voters said they could not envision a scenario that would cause them to pull their support for him. But a few noted there might be a financial breaking point depending on how high prices go, and for how long.

“If it goes like $100 for a pair of shoes, for stupid shoes, then we’re gonna have issues then,” said Nyssa, a 33-year-old stay-at-home mom in Pennsylvania, who said she backed Trump in hopes he would bring down grocery prices. “But a couple bucks here and there is not gonna really hurt anything.”

And for a smaller few, the tariff debate has demonstrated that Trump isn’t following through on a key promise, either because of a perceived lack of attention or push to prioritize vengeance over solutions.

David, the Wisconsin man, noted that Trump specifically criticized the Biden administration on high prices during the 2024 campaign.

“And then shortly after coming into office, all sudden the tune changes, and it’s like, ‘Well, we’re going to see some prices go up,’” he said.

Chelsea Linares, a 33-year-old insurance account manager in Georgia, told NBC News that Trump’s work on the economy has been a “slower start that I would say myself, and others, have anticipated,” noting prices are still high. While she’s still “optimistic,” she thinks “it’s going to get worse before it gets better.”

“Even people that support Trump are probably going to be more pissed than they thought,” she said, adding that she still supported him.

Blake, a three-time Trump voter from Arizona who is in his 30s, described himself as someone in “full ideological agreement” with the president on many issues. He said he would have scored Trump a 10/10 for his administration’s efforts in its first few days on issues including immigration and ending diversity, equity and inclusion programs.

But he panned the tariff rollout as “lazy,” adding that the push could squander the full control of Washington that voters gave Republicans after the 2024 election.

“I could be wrong, but I feel the cannonball way they came out with this is maximizing the pain without necessarily optimizing the speed we recover from it,” he said."

Sherry Behr, a 67-year-old Republican from Pennsylvania, said, “I trust President Trump, that in six months, a year, we’ll start seeing a difference.”

Most Trump voters said they could not envision a scenario that would cause them to pull their support for him. But a few noted there might be a financial breaking point depending on how high prices go, and for how long.

“If it goes like $100 for a pair of shoes, for stupid shoes, then we’re gonna have issues then,” said Nyssa, a 33-year-old stay-at-home mom in Pennsylvania, who said she backed Trump in hopes he would bring down grocery prices. “But a couple bucks here and there is not gonna really hurt anything.”

And for a smaller few, the tariff debate has demonstrated that Trump isn’t following through on a key promise, either because of a perceived lack of attention or push to prioritize vengeance over solutions.

David, the Wisconsin man, noted that Trump specifically criticized the Biden administration on high prices during the 2024 campaign.

“And then shortly after coming into office, all sudden the tune changes, and it’s like, ‘Well, we’re going to see some prices go up,’” he said.

Chelsea Linares, a 33-year-old insurance account manager in Georgia, told NBC News that Trump’s work on the economy has been a “slower start that I would say myself, and others, have anticipated,” noting prices are still high. While she’s still “optimistic,” she thinks “it’s going to get worse before it gets better.”

“Even people that support Trump are probably going to be more pissed than they thought,” she said, adding that she still supported him.

Blake, a three-time Trump voter from Arizona who is in his 30s, described himself as someone in “full ideological agreement” with the president on many issues. He said he would have scored Trump a 10/10 for his administration’s efforts in its first few days on issues including immigration and ending diversity, equity and inclusion programs.

But he panned the tariff rollout as “lazy,” adding that the push could squander the full control of Washington that voters gave Republicans after the 2024 election.

“I could be wrong, but I feel the cannonball way they came out with this is maximizing the pain without necessarily optimizing the speed we recover from it,” he said."
105,"As President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariff plans sent stocks tumbling and economists warning of a broader economic slowdown, many of Trump’s supporters say they support the move as part of a broader vision for the U.S. economy, even if prices rise.

But a slice of 2024 Trump voters are deeply concerned, illustrating the real potential political peril for the president and his party.

In interviews, 20 swing-state Trump voters who participated in last month’s national NBC News poll spoke about Trump and his tariffs after the president's policy announcement last week. Most are either fully on board with Trump’s vision — with many explicitly saying they are willing to live through short-term economic pain if it means achieving his vision of reordering the global economy to America’s benefit — or are cautiously optimistic that the tariffs will be effective negotiating tools.

Veronica Rogers, a retiree in Georgia, was among those who said that Trump’s long-term goals of bringing back jobs to the United States outweigh her concerns about temporary higher prices.

“Whether that’d be short term, or that’d be long term, I don’t know. I’m not an economist. But I do know that there’s billions and trillions of dollars that can be spent here to build industry to keep from paying tariffs. So, that sounds good to me,” she said. She was stunned that some people were taken aback by the scale of Trump’s tariffs, noting how frequently he talked about tariffs while campaigning.

“Nothing they’re doing is news to people that voted for him,” Rogers, 63, said.

Still, a handful of voters, including those who backed Trump in 2020 and 2024, warned that his tariff rollout threatens to squander one of his major campaign promises: to lower prices for Americans in the long term. The NBC News poll conducted in March, before Trump fully unveiled his tariff plans, found that a majority of Americans (55%) disapproved of his handling of inflation and the cost of living, while 54% disapproved of his handling of the economy overall. Members of the GOP were far more likely to give Trump passing marks on the economy than were independents and Democrats, but about 1 in 10 Republicans expressed displeasure with his handling of the key issues.

“The track he’s on right now is just to piss the Democrats off, and I think it’s kind of working, but no, I’m not really too happy with the way things are going right now. He’s really gone off the wall,” said Cathy Phillips, a 64-year-old Pennsylvanian who voted for Trump in 2020 and 2024.

“We’re scraping pennies together, I know how hard it is for us,” she continued. “I can’t imagine how hard it is for seniors who are even older than us. Something’s gotta give somewhere.”

Trusting Trump

Yet, for many of these voters, Trump’s decision to put heavy tariffs on some of America’s biggest trading partners, such as the European Union, China and Vietnam, as well as most other countries, is exactly what they signed up for.

“I feel like everything that I voted for has come to fruition already and more,” said Melanie Renaud, a 52-year-old dental hygienist from North Carolina.

Some point to local factories that shuttered and moved jobs overseas, leaving behind crumbling communities, to argue for drastic steps to bring jobs back to the U.S. Others believe some of the sky-high tariff rates are a hard-edged negotiating tactic aimed at compelling countries to make immediate concessions that will help the American economy in the long term. Others said it’s a needed response to an economy they believe wasn’t working for them.

“This trade war has to happen in order for fair trade to happen. And once fair trade is accomplished, I think prices will even back out,” said Reece Westfall, a 30-year-old Pennsylvania Republican.

“There’s a lot more to this than the price of everything,” Westfall continued, echoing recent arguments from Trump administration officials, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on NBC News’ “Meet the Press.”

Donna J., 55, who declined to give her last name, said that while her part of North Carolina had a long history of textile mills like the one in which her grandfather worked, the town “basically folded in upon itself” once that factory closed. “What you get used to, sometimes, is the very thing that will kill you,” she said of how the globalized economy has hurt communities like hers. She said Americans need to “learn some patience and understand this is for the betterment of everyone,” calling the tariffs an example of Trump’s “promises made, promises kept.”

Some criticize Trump’s moves

But other voters who backed Trump were critical of the president’s approach. David, a Wisconsin man who voted for Trump in 2020 and 2024, said the administration is “throwing spaghetti at the wall to see what sticks.” (Like some others who were critical of Trump, he declined to share his last name because of concerns about retribution or harassment.)

“I cannot see a reasonable businessperson in the near term looking at this and saying, ‘I feel confident that I can invest millions of dollars into a new production facility and create new jobs in the U.S.,” he said, later adding, “I was expecting a more reasoned and logical rollout.”

David said he voted for Trump because of the economy, believing a continuation of Biden administration policies if Kamala Harris had won the election would not have been good for the country.

But despite his hesitance about Trump’s economic policies, David said he would still vote for him if given a chance for a do-over, even if it was less than a full-throated support.

“I would like to think that there would be a better option in the future,” he added.

Another Trump voter, who declined to give his first or last name because of concerns about harassment or retaliation, said he now sees his vote for Trump as a “big mistake.” The 64-year-old Arizona man said his retirement savings have fallen 35% in recent weeks, and he may now have to delay his retirement.

“It’s happened without any reasonable explanation,” he said “I don’t understand. I don’t understand how to declare a trade war on the world, how to betray the allies, I can’t understand it.”

Seeing a potential exit strategy

Many of the Trump voters who spoke to NBC News said they didn’t believe the high tariffs would last, instead predicting that they would compel other countries to the negotiating table.

“I wouldn’t be surprised if, in the next month or two, we see a lot of these countries do bilateral negotiations,” said John, a 30-year-old from Arizona who voted for Trump in 2016 and 2024 but supported Joe Biden in 2020.

“Part of these extremely high tariffs are designed, in a sense, in my belief, as a way to get more from these countries,” he continued.

Ultimately, some of Trump’s most ardent supporters said they would be personally willing to take their lumps now, both in terms of potential rising prices and an unstable stock market, if it meant that the president's plans to reorient the global economy succeed, because they believe it will leave a better future for their children.

“I’m willing to not look at my [401k] numbers on a daily basis. I’m willing to trust President Trump that it will turn around,” said Jodi L., a 62-year-old from Michigan. “I have to do my part. I can call up and complain all I want, but I believe it’s on the right path to turning this country around. I believe in him and what he’s said he would do because he’s proven himself in less than 100 days.”
