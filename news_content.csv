31.03.25,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/06/us/elections/donald-trump-supporters.html?searchResultPosition=1,"We were standing inside a barn when she said this. Mr. Trump was a few yards away, sitting at a big wooden table. Behind him were stacked bales of hay and a John Deere tractor. He led a discussion about seed cost and fertilizer and shale and animal feed. Farmers nodded along as he reminded them how expensive everything had become because of inflation. “I feel very comfortable with the farmers,” he said. And they felt very comfortable with him.

The bond with Mr. Trump deepened for many people after the assassination attempt in Butler, Pa., in July. Mark Zuckerberg, a co-founder of Facebook, said that the way Mr. Trump had popped back up and yelled “Fight!” was “one of the most badass things” he had ever seen — and many people seemed to agree. It was an interesting inversion: Before that point, Mr. Trump had only ever played a tough guy on television, palling around with wrestlers and practicing his Clint Eastwood squint. Now he had behaved in an undeniably tough way on TV. People across the country began to regard him as a cross between Rambo and John Gotti. They posted memes and wore T-shirts that showed his mug shot or his bloodied face. Americans love their antiheroes and action movies. The campaign embraced the “badass” aesthetic. When Mr. Trump returned to Butler in early October, there were military veterans jumping out of airplanes, parachuting into the rally while AC/DC blasted from the speakers.

But beyond the merchandise and the high-octane stunts, the shooting provided Mr. Trump a new way to connect with certain people on a spiritual level. Until that point, some religious types had embraced Mr. Trump with reluctance, seeing him as an imperfect vessel at best. Now there were some who saw evidence of the divine in his survival — the way he had just happened to turn his head at the last moment, dodging a literal bullet. A school bus driver told me in Butler that she was now “1,000 percent” sure that Mr. Trump had been chosen by God to vanquish evil and that his victory was preordained. It was an idea I heard over and over in the crowd. Again, Mr. Trump leaned in. He began communicating in new ways. On social media, he posted images of St. Michael the Archangel battling demons. He talked a lot about blood, and made curiously pious gestures, like when he slowly bent his head onstage at the Republican convention to kiss the helmet of a volunteer firefighter who had been killed in Butler. Religious scholars and experts in Christian martyrdom told me they were surprised at the newly sophisticated ways in which Mr. Trump was deploying Christian iconography. He had come a long way from writing “HAPPY GOOD FRIDAY TO ALL!” on social media in 2020 and talking about “Two Corinthians” a few years before that.

A ‘horrible city’

Mr. Trump’s rally in the lakeside town of Racine, Wis., in June seemed as though it had the potential to be awkward. Earlier that day, it had been reported that, during a closed-door meeting with congressional Republicans, he had called Milwaukee a “horrible city.” Much was made of this, given that the Republican National Convention would soon be held in Milwaukee. But what was treated as an embarrassing moment by the news media and his adversaries didn’t register with anyone I spoke to at the rally that day. Nobody was offended or surprised that he had referred to their metro area that way. They agreed with him about the state of things. They figured he was out to make it better. The uproar around his remark only amused them. There was often a split screen between the way the news media interpreted the things Mr. Trump said and how his voters heard them. (In October, I was in Detroit, listening to him trash Detroit. This became the subject of that day’s headlines. He would go on to flip Michigan.)"

Within minutes of Mr. Trump’s taking the witness stand on Monday, his civil fraud trial in Manhattan devolved into a chaotic spectacle before a packed house. The former president lashed out at his accusers and denied their claims, even while conceding involvement in some of the conduct at the case’s heart.

Ranting and rambling as the courtroom pulsed with tension, Mr. Trump attacked New York’s attorney general, Letitia James, as a “political hack.” He derided the proceeding as “a very unfair trial.” And he scolded the judge overseeing the case, Arthur F. Engoron, for having decided before the trial that he had committed fraud.

“He called me a fraud, and he didn’t know anything about me!” Mr. Trump exclaimed from the stand, pointing at the judge, who flashed a grin."

Trump’s request to dismiss his criminal conviction in the wake of his electoral victory, signaling instead their willingness to freeze the case while he holds office.

In a letter to the judge overseeing the case, prosecutors from the Manhattan district attorney’s office emphasized that a jury had already convicted Mr. Trump of falsifying records to cover up a sex scandal. Prosecutors and judges are often loath to unravel a jury’s verdict.

But acknowledging the unprecedented nature of the case — Mr. Trump would be the first felon to serve as president — the prosecutors raised the prospect of a four-year freeze so that he will not be sentenced for his crimes until he is out of office.

The judge, Juan M. Merchan, will decide in the coming weeks whether to freeze the case or dismiss it outright, a momentous ruling that will shape the outcome of the only one of Mr. Trump’s four criminal cases that made it to trial. Dismissing the case would further embolden Mr. Trump as he enters his second presidential term, solidifying an aura of invincibility around him."

For all of them, he deployed a common threat: Countries that did not meet his demands would face stiff tariffs on products they send to American consumers.

Mr. Trump has long wielded tariffs as a weapon to resolve trade concerns. But the president is now frequently using them to make gains on issues that have little to do with trade.

It is a strategy rarely seen from other presidents, and never at this frequency. While Mr. Trump threatened governments like Mexico’s with tariffs over immigration issues in his first term, he now appears to be making such threats almost daily, including on Sunday, when he said Colombia would face tariffs after its government turned back planes carrying deported immigrants."

If her office proves its case, the judge overseeing the trial could impose an array of punishments on Mr. Trump, including a $250 million penalty.

Outside the courtroom, Mr. Trump fired a fusillade of personal attacks on Ms. James and the judge, Arthur F. Engoron. He called the judge “rogue” and Ms. James “a terrible person,” even suggesting that they were criminals.

Inside, Mr. Trump sat in uncomfortable silence as Ms. James’s lawyers methodically laid out their case. The attorney general’s office accused the former president of inflating his riches by more than $2 billion to obtain favorable deals with banks and bragging rights about his wealth."

The mere announcement of the duties last week sent shock waves through global markets and caused trillions of dollars in paper losses. Now, consumers and investors alike will begin to gauge the actual impact on the U.S. economy as the cost of the import taxes starts to flow through supply chains and into businesses and household budgets.

The average tariff faced by the dozens of nations Trump targeted is 29%, with many as high as 40%. The White House posted the full list here. Chinese imports will carry a cumulative rate of 104% because of new tariffs Trump imposed this year, on top of levies he had already enacted during his first term. Those took effect late Tuesday.

Trump is seeking to reshape the global world economic order by reducing America’s reliance on foreign imports. Amid debate about how the country-by-country tariffs were calculated, Trump has acknowledged that his goal all along was to effectively erase or even reverse the U.S. trade deficit, which most economists say serves little purpose and is likely to lead to higher prices and potentially slower economic growth.

Already, Trump has instituted a 10% baseline tariff on goods brought into the United States. And while he said he would negotiate over trade, he gave little sign of relenting, only posting a note in the morning that he believed China would seek a deal alongside other potential agreements his administration is discussing with Japan, South Korea and other countries.

Tariffs are nothing new, and many business leaders have long argued that the United States must do more to prevent some low-cost goods, especially from China, from flooding its markets.

But Trump shocked the world with his attempt to bring to the United States the production of a vast array of goods that are, in most cases, produced more affordably overseas.

“It’s too much too fast,” said Craig Fuller, founder and CEO of FreightWaves, a logistics consultancy. Businesses — especially small ones — are simply not equipped to alter their supply chains at the speed and scale Trump desires, he added, and will face enormous cost increases in the meantime while they try to reckon with them.

“It’s not realistic,” Fuller said.

Trump has shown little appetite for taking “no” for an answer, even as financial markets plunged.

On Monday, he told reporters at the White House that “I don’t mind going through it because I see a beautiful picture at the end,” because “tariffs will make this country very rich.”

Economists are not as sanguine about the tariff program. Many are sounding alarms about what could be next. In a note to clients ahead of Wednesday’s deadline, analysts with Wells Fargo said the tariffs would be likely to cause a “modest” stagflationary “shock” to the U.S. economy: As prices go up, they will contribute to eroding real income growth, causing spending and overall economic activity to contract, they said.

And if other countries retaliate with tariffs that are equivalent to the levies the United States has already slapped on them, they wrote, “then the contraction in real GDP is even deeper.”

“The downturn in the economy causes the unemployment rate to rise from its current level of roughly 4% to about 5%,” they wrote.

That 5% unemployment figure echoes similar projections last week from analysts with JPMorgan, who said “the pinch from higher prices that we expect in the coming months may hit harder than in the post-pandemic inflation spike,” given that income growth was already slowing.

“Moreover, in an environment of heightened uncertainty, consumers may be reluctant to dip too far into savings to finance spending growth.”

Several countries are already retaliating. With the tariffs’ taking effect Wednesday, Canada said it was instituting 25% duties on some U.S.-made automobiles and all U.S.-made auto parts.

“President Trump caused this trade crisis — and Canada is responding with purpose and with force,” Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney wrote Tuesday on X.

China has already hit back with 34% tariffs on American products — mostly energy and agricultural products — prompting Trump to say new duties on Chinese goods would go into effect Wednesday. China is also considering a ban on U.S. cultural exports like movies.

Perhaps most worrisome is that lower borrowing rates Trump sought to better grapple with his budget plans have not materialized. Late Tuesday, the yield, or interest rate, that investors demand to lend money to the government had surged back above the level it had hit before Trump’s tariffs rollout last week.

For all the massive moves in financial markets that have already taken place, one expert says it may only be the beginning.

“A historical shift in trade policy ... will not be digested that quickly,” Jens Nordvig, founder and CEO of Exante Data financial consultancy, wrote late Tuesday on X. “It could take weeks and months and even quarters, before we have their full effects embedded. “"

The Trump administration plans to fine migrants under deportation orders up to $998 a day if they fail to leave the United States and to seize their property if they do not pay, according to documents reviewed by Reuters.

The fines stem from a 1996 law that was enforced for the first time in 2018, during President Donald Trump’s first term in office. The Trump administration plans to apply the penalties retroactively for up to five years, which could result in fines of more than $1 million, a senior Trump official said, requesting anonymity to discuss non-public plans.

The Trump administration is also considering seizing the property of immigrants who do not pay the fines, according to government emails reviewed by Reuters.

In response to questions from Reuters, U.S. Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that immigrants in the U.S. illegally should use a mobile app formerly known as CBP One — rebranded as CBP Home under Trump — to “self deport and leave the country now.”

“If they don’t, they will face the consequences,” McLaughlin said. “This includes a fine of $998 per day for every day that the illegal alien overstayed their final deportation order.”

DHS warned of the fines in a March 31 social media post.

Emails reviewed by Reuters show the White House has pressed U.S. Customs and Border Protection to handle the issue of penalties, property seizures for migrants who don’t pay, and the sale of their assets.

The Department of Justice’s civil asset forfeiture division could be another option for the seizures, one email said.

President Donald Trump kicked off a sweeping immigration crackdown after taking office in January, testing the bounds of U.S. law to increase arrests and deportations. The planned fines target the roughly 1.4 million migrants who have been ordered removed by an immigration judge.

White House pressure

Trump invoked the 1996 law during his first term to levy fines of hundreds of thousands of dollars against nine migrants seeking sanctuary in churches. The administration withdrew the penalties, but then proceeded with smaller fines of about $60,000 per person against at least four of the migrants, according to court records.

President Joe Biden stopped issuing the fines and rescinded related policies when he took office in 2021.

Scott Shuchart, a top ICE policy official under Biden, said migrants and their supporters could challenge the fines in court but that the threat alone could have a chilling effect.

“Their point isn’t really to enforce the law, it’s to project fear in communities,” he said.

DHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The proposed asset seizures against the migrants who fail to comply with final deportation orders could impact U.S. citizens or permanent residents in their households.

The immigration advocacy group FWD.us estimates that some 10 million migrants with no legal status or temporary protections are living with U.S. citizens or permanent residents in what are known as “mixed status households.”

The steep fines could hit lower-income immigrants. An analysis of 2019 Census data by the non-partisan Migration Policy Institute found 26% of households with unauthorized immigrants had incomes below the federal poverty line.

Trump has said people with final deportation orders should be a priority for removal although many have families, jobs and established ties in the U.S.

The White House National Security Council and Stephen Miller, deputy chief of staff for policy, have been pressing CBP to administer the fines and handle seizures, a CBP official wrote in a March 31 email reviewed by Reuters.

But a CBP memo a day later, also reviewed by Reuters, argued for ICE to take on the task instead. The memo said that CBP’s systems do not currently support this type of immigration fine and that upgrading it could lead to significant costs and implementation delays.

The memo anticipated CBP would need at least 1,000 new paralegal specialists, up from the current staffing of 313.

The start date for the fines remained unclear. DHS did not comment on Miller’s involvement or the technical aspects of implementing the penalties."
29.03.25,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/trump-says-us-will-hold-direct-talks-iran-insists-tehran-cant-get-nucl-rcna200135,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump said Monday the U.S. will hold direct talks with Iran about its nuclear program, while warning the Iranians they would be in “great danger” if the talks don’t succeed in persuading them to abandon their nuclear weapons program.

The president, in comments to reporters after meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said the talks will start Saturday. He insisted Tehran can’t get nuclear weapons.

“We’re dealing with them directly and maybe a deal is going to be made,” Trump said. He added that “doing a deal would be preferable to doing the obvious.”

Asked if he would commit to military action against Iran should his negotiators be unable to come to terms with Tehran, Trump responded that “Iran is going to be in great danger, and I hate to say it.”

“If the talks aren’t successful, I think it’s going to be a very bad day for Iran,” Trump said.

Iran’s mission at the United Nations had no immediate comment Monday.

Trump recently sent a letter to Iran’s supreme leader, 85-year-old Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, calling for direct negotiations with the United States over its rapidly advancing nuclear program. But Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said late last month that Iran had rejected Trump’s entreaty while leaving open the possibility of indirect negotiations with Washington.

But Trump has consistently called on Iran, which is the chief sponsor of Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon and Houthi militants in Yemen, to abandon its nuclear program or face a reckoning.

“If they don’t make a deal, there will be bombing,” Trump told NBC News in late March. “It will be bombing the likes of which they have never seen before.”

Tehran’s chief envoy to the U.N., Ambassador Amir Saeid Iravani, has called on members of the Security Council in a series of letters to condemn Trump’s threats of bombing Iran.

Trump during his first White House term withdrew the U.S. from the landmark nuclear accord with Iran negotiated by Democratic President Barack Obama’s administration.

Netanyahu says he supports Trump’s diplomatic efforts to reach a settlement with Iran, adding that Israel and the U.S. share the same goal of ensuring that Iran does not develop a nuclear weapon.

The Israeli leader, known for his hawkish views on Iran and past calls for military pressure, said he would welcome a diplomatic agreement along the lines of Libya’s deal with the international community in 2003.

“I think that would be a good thing,” he said. “But whatever happens, we have to make sure that Iran does not have nuclear weapons.”

Trump said the talks would happen “at almost the highest level,” but declined to say where the negotiations would take place or who he was dispatching for the sensitive diplomacy.

The Middle East sultanate of Oman was an important conduit for previous U.S.-Iran negotiations and has been the go-between for the recent swap of letters about reopening negotiations between Trump and Khamenei.

Trump announced plans for the surprise engagement as Netanyahu made a hastily arranged visit to the White House — his second in just over two months — to discuss the tariffs Trump has unleashed on countries around the world, Iran’s nuclear program and the Israel-Hamas war.

In withdrawing the U.S. from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, Trump declared he was making the world safer, but he also deepened his isolation on the world stage and revived doubts about American credibility.

The agreement, which also included Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia, had lifted most U.S. and international economic sanctions against Iran.

“I think it’ll be, different and maybe a lot stronger,” Trump said on how a new deal might be different from the one negotiated by Obama officials.

Trump and Netanyahu said they also discussed tensions with Iran, Israel-Turkey ties and the International Criminal Court, which issued an arrest warrant against the Israeli leader last year. Trump in February signed an executive order imposing sanctions on the ICC over its investigations of Israel.

Before his meeting with Netanyahu, Trump held a call with French President Emmanuel Macron, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi and Jordan’s King Abdullah II. All three leaders have been key interlocutors in efforts to tamp down tensions in the Middle East and bring an end to the Israel-Hamas war.

The prime minister soon after arriving in Washington on Sunday evening met with senior Trump administration officials, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and U.S. Trade Representative Jameson Greer, to discuss the tariffs. And Netanyahu met on Monday with Steve Witkoff, Trump’s special envoy to the Middle East, ahead of his sit down with the president.

On tariffs, Netanyahu said he assured Trump that his government would move to erase the trade deficit. U.S.-Israel trade was $37 billion last year, according to the office of the U.S. Trade Representative. The trade deficit was $7.4 billion.

“We will eliminate the trade deficit with the United States,” Netanyahu said “We intend to do it very quickly.”

Trump noted that in addition to the trade deficit the U.S. provides Israel nearly $4 billion in assistance per year — much of it in military aid. Asked if he might be willing to reduce Israel’s tariff rate, Trump replied, “Maybe not, maybe not. Don’t forget we help Israel a lot.”

Eytan Gilboa, an expert on U.S.-Israel relations, said he expected Trump to use the tariffs as leverage to force concessions from Netanyahu.

In Israel’s case, those concessions might not be economic. Trump may pressure Netanyahu to move toward ending the war in Gaza — at the very least through some interim truce with Hamas that would pause the fighting and free more hostages. Gilboa said Trump is hoping to return from his first overseas trip — expected next month to Saudi Arabia — with some movement on a deal to normalize relations with Israel, which would likely require significant Israeli concessions on Gaza.

If he does manage to move toward bolstering ties between Israel and Saudi Arabia, that would act as a regional diplomatic counterweight to pressure Iran, against which Trump has threatened new sanctions and suggested military action over its nuclear program.

In a preemptive move last week, Israel announced that it was removing all tariffs on goods from the U.S., mostly on imported food and agricultural products, according to a statement from Netanyahu’s office.

But the tactic failed, and with a 17% rate, Israel was just one of dozens of countries that were slapped with tariffs on Trump’s so-called Liberation Day last week.

Although Israel is a tiny market for U.S. products, the United States is a key trade partner of Israel. Much of that trade is for high-tech services, which are not directly affected by the tariffs, but key Israeli industries could be impacted.

The Manufacturers Association of Israel estimates that the tariffs will cost Israel about $3 billion in exports each year and lead to the loss of 26,000 jobs in industries that include biotechnology, chemicals, plastics and electronics. The World Bank says Israel’s gross domestic product, a measure of economic output, is over $500 billion a year.

“The damage won’t stop at exports,” said Ron Tomer, the group’s president. “It will scare investors, encourage companies to leave Israel and undermine our image as a global center of innovation.”"
29.03.25,https://www.nbcnews.com/science/climate-change/trump-signs-executive-order-boost-us-coal-industry-part-fuel-artificia-rcna200269,"President Donald Trump signed executive orders Tuesday to bolster the country’s declining coal industry, relaxing restrictions on coal mining, leasing and exports in what the White House said was an effort to meet the energy-intensive needs of artificial intelligence data centers.

The executive orders were the latest moves by the Trump administration that clash with global aims to reduce coal power and cut harmful greenhouse gas emissions that fuel climate change.

Standing before dozens of coal miners in uniform shirts and hard hats, Trump introduced the orders, repeatedly referring to “beautiful, clean coal.”

Coal is considered the dirtiest fossil fuel and historically the biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions. Burning fossil fuels, which unleashes carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, is the primary contributor to global warming.

Trump’s executive actions will keep open some coal plants that were set for retirement, allow coal leasing on public lands to resume and will direct the Department of Energy and other federal agencies to assess how electricity from coal-fired power plants can meet rising demand for power from artificial intelligence.

The orders come as the Environmental Protection Agency under its new administrator, Lee Zeldin, has been aggressively rolling back various environmental regulations over the past month, including ones that target pollution from power plants and emissions generated by oil and gas companies.

The coal industry has been in decline in the U.S. for more than a decade. In 2023, coal generated about 16% of total electricity in the country, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration — down sharply from roughly 45% in 2010. The rise of renewable energy sources, including solar and wind power, have also lessened the country’s reliance on coal.

The push to revive the coal industry also runs counter to most Americans’ priorities, according to the latest public opinion research from Yale University.

The national survey found that two-thirds of Americans support a transition away from fossil fuels like coal to entirely clean energy by 2050. The research also found even broader support for regulating carbon dioxide as a pollutant, with 74% of those surveyed in favor of such regulations. Coal power produces more than twice as much carbon dioxide per kilowatt hour of electricity as gas power plants.

Burning coal to generate electricity could also cost Americans three to four times more than clean energy, according to estimates from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Adding coal power would cost $89 per megawatt hour, compared with $31 for onshore wind or $23 for solar.

In widespread job cuts last week across the Department of Health and Human Services, the Trump administration also eliminated several entire divisions focused on the safety of mining workers.

Critics were quick to denounce Trump’s executive orders, with former EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy saying the action will exacerbate climate change and damage public health.

“There is no such thing as clean coal,” McCarthy, who also served as White House national climate adviser in the Biden administration, said in a statement. “Just as Trump’s tariffs are hitting Americans’ wallets, his administration is wasting taxpayer dollars to prop up an expensive, dangerous, and dirty industry when we have abundant, cheaper, better, and safer clean energy.”

The rise of artificial intelligence has spurred a hunt for new energy resources, with some in tech pushing money toward more sustainable sources including nuclear energy. But the demand for energy from AI is expected to test even the relatively big and robust U.S. system, with some calling for greater investment in an effort to keep up with international rivals, most notably China.

Earlier this year, Goldman Sachs projected that the expansion of AI data centers will increase global power demand by 165% in the next five years."
29.03.25,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/trump-panama-canal-take-back-military-china-blackrock-rcna199438,"HONG KONG — A huge deal President Donald Trump touted as a victory in his campaign to “take back” the Panama Canal from China could be on the rocks amid pushback from Beijing.

The $23 billion sale involving two ports run by CK Hutchison, a private company based in the Chinese territory of Hong Kong, to a consortium led by the U.S. investment firm BlackRock had been scheduled to be signed last week.

But an agreement between the two has been delayed under pressure from China, whose market regulator launched a review of the deal as state-run newspapers attacked it as undermining China’s national interests.

NBC News takes a look at the sale and what it may mean politically and economically for the United States and China, the world’s two biggest economies.

Why is it important?

In his inaugural speech in January, Trump claimed without providing evidence that China controlled the 50-mile canal and vowed that the United States will take back the waterway, which he said was “vital” to national security. The Panamanian government has administered the U.S.-built canal since the United States relinquished it to the Central American country in 1999.

Trump did not rule out military action, and he has directed the Defense Department to draw up plans to send more troops to Panama to “reclaim” the canal, through which 40% of U.S. trade passes.

Panama denies Trump’s accusations about the neutrality of the canal, which is enshrined in its constitution. But to relieve the pressure from Washington, in January it launched an audit of CK Hutchison’s Panama Ports Co. (PPC), which since 1997 has operated two ports along the canal, Balboa on the Pacific side and Cristóbal on the Atlantic side.

On Monday, Panama’s comptroller general said the audit had found that the contract was overly favorable to Hutchison PPC, costing Panama $1.3 billion in revenue, and that authorities would sue officials involved in its renewal in 2021.

CK Hutchison is negotiating the sale to BlackRock, which includes a 90% interest in the two Panama Canal ports and an 80% controlling interest in 43 other ports outside Hong Kong and China. When the deal was announced March 4, the companies said definitive documentation for the Panama Canal operations would be signed by April 2.

Trump quickly declared victory. “To further enhance our national security, my administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal, and we’ve already started doing it,” he said in an address to Congress last month, citing the proposed deal.

China’s 'long-arm' jurisdiction

The sale of the two Chinese-run ports is about more than just Panama, said Christopher Hernandez-Roy, senior fellow and deputy director of the Americas Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based think tank.

“It represents a major victory for the Trump administration’s efforts to roll back China in the Western Hemisphere,” he said, adding that is something China “would not want to happen.”

Though CK Hutchison, owned by billionaire Li Ka-shing, is a private company based in Hong Kong, a semiautonomous territory, Beijing quickly signaled its displeasure with the deal.

China “firmly opposes using economic coercion and bullying to harm other countries’ legitimate rights and interests,” Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said last week.

Chinese government offices in Hong Kong have reposted articles from pro-Beijing newspapers criticizing the sale as undermining China’s national interest. Beijing’s market regulator has also said the sale is subject to an antitrust review “to protect fair market competition and safeguard public interests.”

The original signing date of April 2 came and went last week."

Trump digs in on tariffs amid another volatile day for the stock market

President Donald Trump pressed forward with aggressive tariffs that have roiled the global economy as he faced pushback from Wall Street, world leaders and some members of his own party.

Here’s the latest on where the trade war stands:

Trump plows ahead: Trump said he is “not looking” to pause his tariffs before they go into effect Wednesday.

“We have many, many countries that are coming to negotiate deals with us,” Trump said. “They’re going to be fair deals, and in certain cases, they’re going to be paying substantial tariffs.”

Asked whether the tariffs are permanent or open to negotiation — a point his advisers struggled to clarify last week — Trump insisted that “they can both be true.”

“There could be permanent, and there could also be negotiations, because there are things that we need beyond tariffs,” he said. “So we’re going to get fair deals and good deals with every country.”

Stock market volatility: The markets ended largely lower Monday after a wild trading day. The S&P closed down 0.2%, while the Dow Jones Industrial average fell 0.9%, or 350 points. The tech-heavy Nasdaq ended the day up 0.1%, led by a rally in chipmaker Nvidia, which finished 3.5% higher.

U.S. markets whipsawed as investors grasped for any shred of news that indicated Trump would relent on his tariffs plan. A widely circulated but false headline saying he was considering a 90-day pause sent markets skyrocketing for a brief time.

New threat over China: Trump threatened additional tariffs of 50% on China if it doesn’t rescind its retaliatory measures of 34%. That’s in addition to his announcement last week, meaning the total tariffs on goods imported into the United States from China would be as much as 104% if they were fully implemented.

Talks with Japan: Trump said Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba “was sending a top team to negotiate” after the two leaders spoke over the phone.

Calling Trump’s 24% tariff on Japanese goods “extremely unfortunate,” Ishiba — whose country is the single largest foreign investor in the United States — said he told Trump during their 25-minute call that he was “deeply concerned that these American tariff measures will reduce the investment capacity of Japanese companies.”

The view from Wall Street: Major figures in the business world have spent the last few days sounding the alarm about the economic consequences of Trump’s tariff policies, with some even reversing their previous supportive stances of him.

JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said in his annual shareholder letter that Trump’s tariffs would “slow down growth” as “input costs rise and demand increases on domestic products.” On Friday, the bank raised its odds for a recession from 40% to 60%.

Dimon’s comments are a sharp reversal from those he made in January urging people to “get over” Trump’s tariff policy because they were “good for national security.”

Billionaire investor Bill Ackman said on X that “the global economy is being taken down because of bad math,” capping off a weekend of missives that called for a 90-day pause on tariff implementation and others aimed at Trump’s policy team.

“This is not what we voted for,” wrote Ackman, who endorsed Trump during the 2024 campaign.

The view from Capitol Hill: Republicans in Congress are still largely sticking by Trump through the tariff turbulence, though new cracks have continued to emerge.

A bipartisan Senate bill that would limit the president’s power to impose tariffs now has seven Republican co-sponsors. But the White House officially said Trump would veto the legislation if it reached his desk, meaning it would take two-thirds of the GOP-controlled House and Senate to turn it into law. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said of the bill: “I don’t think that has a future.”

Meanwhile, Republican Sens. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Mike Lee of Utah posted on X in favor of Trump’s taking up the European Union on its offer of zero-for-zero tariffs.

Over in the House, some anxious Republicans are seeking more guidance about Trump’s broader plans. During a House GOP conference call over the weekend, Rep. Darrell Issa, of California, asked whether lawmakers could get a detailed briefing from the White House about Trump’s tariffs. And Rep. French Hill, of Arkansas, the chairman of the Financial Services Committee, expressed some frustration with how the White House has handled the tariff situation.

Still, Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said Congress would give Trump “the space necessary” to handle tariffs.

These tariffs are a huge hit for anyone in China who wants to sell into the US market.

It's just a waiting game now as we prepare for the Chinese government to reveal its promised counter measures.

It could come later today or tomorrow - but there will definitely be some sort of response.

The message from Beijing has been that they can ride this out.

Donald Trump's spokesperson says there's a belief that China has to negotiate - well, China doesn’t think it has to do anything.

This is a massive, powerful country and Beijing is saying it won’t kowtow to a bully."
28.03.25,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/crm332189djo,"US President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs targeting most of the world are now in effect – and outside China, no other region has been hit as hard as South East Asia.

Near the top of the list are Vietnam and Cambodia which have been hit by some of the highest tariffs: 46% and 49%. Further down are Thailand (36%), Indonesia (32%) and Malaysia (24%). The Philippines gets a tariff of 17%, and Singapore of 10%.

This is a huge blow for a region highly dependent on exports. Its widely-admired economic development over the past three decades has largely been driven by its success in selling its products to the rest of the world, in particular to the US.

Exports to the US contribute 23% of Vietnam's GDP, and 67% of Cambodia's.

That growth story is now imperilled by the punitive measures being imposed in Washington.

The longer-term impact of these tariffs, assuming they stay in place, will vary, but will certainly pose big challenges to the governments of Vietnam, Thailand and Cambodia in particular."
28.03.25,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cwy6nxkpkwpo,"Crucially, the RBI shifted its monetary policy stance to ""accommodative"" from ""neutral"", which means that the central bank would be more open to cutting rates in the future to stimulate a slowing economy.

""Concerns on trade frictions are coming true"" and unsettling the global community, RBI governor Sanjay Malhotra said in his speech, adding that headwinds from disruptions to trade would continue to pose challenges for the economy.

Most economists who had previously expected only one more rate cut this year are now predicting more softening as Trump's tariff war puts growth in the world's fastest growing major economy at risk.

""The magnitude of rate cuts in the cycle now could be as high as 100bps (1%),"" ICICI Bank said in a note, a view echoed by many other analysts.

Moderating inflation will give the RBI further elbow room to slash borrowing costs, according to several brokerages, as growth momentum further loses steam due to Trump's global trade war.

HSBC calculates GDP could take a direct hit of as much as half a percent this financial year due to slower export volumes around the world and weaker inflows of foreign funds.

The government's capacity to stimulate the economy to counter the impact of Trump's tariffs is also limited because ""spending and tax revenues have lost steam in recent months"", according to HSBC.

Starting Wednesday, Indian goods being exported to the US will face additional tariffs of up to 27%.

Tariffs on India are lower than 104% on China and 46% and 49% respectively on Vietnam and Cambodia.

The final impact on India's trade will depend on ""how long the announced tariff structure lasts"", ratings agency Crisil said. ""The outcome will also be influenced by how other countries retaliate or negotiate with the US on tariffs.""

China has already retaliated by imposing 34% reciprocal tariffs on US imports, while Europe is considering counter-measures.

India on the other hand has assumed a more restrained stance and is working towards concluding a trade deal with the US.

India has ""agreed on the importance of the early conclusion of the Bilateral Trade Agreement"", Foreign Minister S Jaishankar said on X (formerly Twitter) this week after his meeting with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio.

But even with a trade deal in place, India's economy is unlikely to be immune to a slowdown in other parts of the world with demand for its exports potentially reducing in the event of global growth falling off a cliff.

Wall Street bank JP Morgan has put the chance of a global recession at 60%, while ratings agency Moody's said the odds had risen from 15% to 35% due to tariffs.

At 6.5%, India continues to remain the world's fastest growing major economy, but its growth has sharply come off the 9.2% high recorded in financial year 2023-24."

The president and his allies say the measures are necessary to restore America's manufacturing base, which they view as essential to national security.

But it remains a potentially seismic action, affecting more than $2tn worth of imports, which will push the overall effective tariff rate in the US to the highest level in more than a century."

WASHINGTON — More than $1 billion in federal funding for Cornell University and around $790 million for Northwestern University have been frozen while the government investigates alleged civil rights violations at both schools, the White House says.

It's part of a broader push to use government funding to get major academic institutions to comply with President Donald Trump 's political agenda. The White House confirmed the funding pauses late Tuesday night, but offered no further details on what it entails, or what grants to the schools are being affected.

The moves come as the Trump administration has increasingly begun using governmental grant funding as a spigot to try and influence campus policy — previously cutting off money to schools including Columbia University and the University of Pennsylvania.

Sponsor Message

That has left universities across the country struggling to navigate cuts to grants for research institutions.

In a statement, Cornell said it had received more than 75 stop work orders earlier Tuesday from the Defense Department related to research ""profoundly significant to American national defense, cybersecurity, and health"" but that it had not otherwise received any information confirming $1 billion in frozen grants.

""We are actively seeking information from federal officials to learn more about the basis for these decisions,"" said the statement from Michael I. Kotlikoff, the university president, and other top school officials.

In an email to the Northwestern community, university president Michael Schill said it had not been notified by the federal government of the cuts, according to The Daily Northwestern, the campus newspaper.

Last month, the Education Department sent letters to more than 60 universities — including Cornell and Northwestern — warning of ""potential enforcement actions if they do not fulfill their obligations"" under federal law to ""protect Jewish students on campus, including uninterrupted access to campus facilities and educational opportunities.""

The Trump administration has threatened to cut off federal funding for universities allowing alleged antisemitism to go unchecked at campus protests last year against Israel's war with Hamas in Gaza — accusations the universities have denied.

Sponsor Message

Officials have already singled out Columbia University, making an example of it with threats to withhold $400 million in federal funds.

The administration repeatedly accused Columbia of failing to stop antisemitism during protests against Israel that began at the New York City university last spring and quickly spread to other campuses — a characterization disputed by those involved in the demonstrations.

As a precondition for restoring that money — along with billions more in future grants — the Republican administration demanded unprecedented changes in university policy.

Columbia's decision to bow to those demands, in part to salvage ongoing research projects at its labs and medical center, has been criticized by some faculty and free speech groups as capitulating to an intrusion on academic freedom."

toggle caption Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images

As market turmoil over President Trump's sweeping tariffs continued to churn, the U.S. trade representative told a Senate panel that the goal of the policy is to negotiate a new series of trade deals.

Jamieson Greer, the U.S. trade representative, said roughly 50 countries reached out to talk with the administration instead of retaliating. That, he suggested, is evidence that Trump's approach is working. But he faced skepticism and questions from Republican lawmakers on the Senate Finance Committee who wanted answers on the broader strategy.

Even the president's allies admitted the mixed messaging coming from the White House was confusing — with some saying Trump's tariffs were a tactic to bring countries to the table to adjust trade imbalances and others saying the tariffs were a longer-term gambit to remake the global trade economy.

Sponsor Message

Tuesday's hearing was the first opportunity for a top Trump official to explain the theory of the case before Congress. Greer assured lawmakers that the goal was to incentivize negotiations.

""As these countries approach us, the idea is that we've had years and years of nonreciprocal access and it's contributed to these trade deficits,"" Greer said, and outlined that if countries present solutions for shifting the dynamic, the message to them is ""we want to negotiate with you.""

He repeatedly pointed to examples of countries like Vietnam and India reaching out.

Later, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that Trump directed his trade team to create ""tailor-made trade deals"" in negotiations with countries seeking tariff cuts.

Leavitt said almost 70 countries have reached out since Trump's bombshell across-the-board tariff announcement last week.

""The president met with his trade team this morning, and he directed them to have tailor-made trade deals with each and every country that calls up this administration to strike a deal,"" she said in a press briefing.

""Each and every one of these trade deals should be tailored and unique based on that country's markets, based on that country's exports, the imports here in the United States of America, what makes the most sense for the American worker and for our industry,"" Leavitt said.

Sponsor Message

On Capitol Hill, Greer made clear that China was taking a much harder line and repeated that Trump's plans to impose new tariffs would go forward as scheduled for midnight. He said China seems ""to be choosing its own path on market access.""

The White House has said tariffs on China are set to rise to at least 104% on Wednesday.

The top Democrat on the committee, Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, pointed to retirement funds falling and markets being shut to U.S. goods, saying, ""The U.S. economy has gone from the envy of the world to a laughingstock in less time than it took to finish March Madness.""

Wyden announced he was introducing a bipartisan privileged resolution that would terminate the national emergency Trump invoked to impose his tariffs. Several Democrats co-sponsored the measure, and Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky also joined the effort. Last week, the Senate approved a similar resolution to undo the tariffs on Canada, with four Republicans joining Democrats. But the House of Representatives has no plans to take up the measure.



Republican skepticism and questions

Top Republican leaders continue to say that the president deserves some time to assess the full impact of his policies. Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, has introduced legislation to claw back congressional power over international trade and tariffs that the legislative branch ceded to the executive branch over decades. Grassley repeated his concerns about that dynamic to Greer. But he also said, ""I support President Trump's agenda to lower tariffs and nontariff barriers other countries impose on American goods.""

But several Republicans on the Senate Finance Committee made it clear they were hearing from worried constituents, including business owners unable to plan for supply chain issues.

Republican Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma pressed Greer for a timeline for the tariffs, but the trade representative declined to specify any target date.

Sponsor Message

Instead, Greer cautioned that the trade deficit was ""decades in the making, but it's not going to be solved overnight.""

Republican Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, who noted his own experience in the manufacturing sector, told Greer he was disappointed that exclusions for some companies ""are being ruled out right now.""

He said, ""I hope you and the president are very sensitive about companies potentially going bankrupt by these actions.""

And Johnson added, ""We want fair trade, but tariffs are a double-edged sword and, I would argue, a somewhat blunt instrument.""

Another Republican, Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, admitted that he wasn't an expert but that the Trump administration faced a tight window of roughly 14 months for these policies to demonstrate they were working. Tillis, who is running for reelection in 2026, noted that people who voted for the president and for him — mentioning he grew up in a trailer park — would face the possible negative impact, like job losses.

""I wish you well, but I am skeptical,"" Tillis concluded.

Sen. Todd Young, R-Ind., asked Greer to factor in that trade retaliation doesn't fall on everyone evenly, noting that tech companies in New York feel impacts differently from soybean farmers in his home state. ""I hope that's something that's being factored into your analysis.""

Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., pressed Greer to explain why the administration took the same approach to allies and partners like Canada and Mexico as with adversaries like China.

He reported that he spoke with senior Wall Street executives and that one remarked about the market's gains on Tuesday as ""a good day in hospice.""

As the markets brace for fallout from increased tariffs on China on Wednesday, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., who has cautioned against broad tariffs, noted on Tuesday that Trump ran on the issue in 2024.

Sponsor Message

""Seventy-seven million people voted for him and his agenda, and I think he deserves the opportunity to see what kind of deals he can get from some of our trading partners, and I think most of us are giving him space in which to do that and hope he's successful, because it's not only good for him and his administration but it's good for the country."""

U.S. stock markets fell once again on Tuesday, continuing a sell-off that has seen equity markets across the world crater since President Trump's announcement of tariffs.

The losses came after U.S. stocks attempted earlier to rebound after shares in Europe and Asia gained on Tuesday following the tumultuous day on global markets on Monday.

But tariff concerns returned later in the session after the White House confirmed it would proceed with a 104% tariff on China that will kick in on Wednesday.

The Dow Jones Industrial average ended down over 300 points, or 0.8%, after earlier gaining as much as 3.8%. The S&P 500 fell 1.6%, while the Nasdaq ended down a little over 2%.

The losses on Tuesday, though not as harsh as in previous few days, will nonetheless add to the value destruction that has already seen trillions of dollars in investor wealth wiped out.



Asia and Eruope rebounded, but uncertainty remains

U.S. investors had earlier been heartened by gains in global markets on Tuesday.

The major stock markets in Hong Kong and Shanghai — the Hang Seng Index and Shanghai Composite, respectively — closed slightly higher on Tuesday, while Tokyo's Nikkei ended the day's trading in Japan up more than 6%. It hit its lowest level in 18 months on Monday, with its listed stocks having lost almost a fifth of value over the past two weeks.

European markets also posted gains on Tuesday, but investors in the continent's major stock markets have also suffered significant losses in the past week, and that's even before exporters have really begun to feel the effects of significant tariffs on European products sold to the United States.

As investors seek out assets that can serve as a bulwark against uncertainty in other markets, the price of gold has continued to soar to above $3,000 an ounce, prompting financial analysts to liken the current geopolitical and economic uncertainty to that of the late 1970s and 1980s, when gold prices also spiked significantly.

And in light of the uncertainty over the United States' future role on the world stage, analysts say another asset usually considered a safe haven for investors — the dollar — may also continue to weaken against other global currencies.



Countries continue reacting to Trump's tariffs

In China, a number of large, government-backed businesses and listed companies have announced they will buy back their own shares, as part of a wider effort to calm the local equity markets.

Officials in China said Tuesday that they wouldn't back down in the face of Trump's threats to impose a further 50% tariff on Chinese exports to the U.S., saying ""China will fight till the end if the U.S. side is bent on going down the wrong path.""

But other countries have expressed willingness to negotiate, according to the White House. For example, President Trump said on social media on Tuesday that South Korea was sending a team to the U.S. to try to negotiate a deal after the U.S also imposed tariffs last week on the Asian country."

TEL AVIV, Israel — Iran says it will have indirect talks with the United States this weekend in Oman, opening a possible path to diplomacy over Iran's nuclear program but revealing a potential sticking point about the format for negotiating.

President Trump said Monday, ""We're having direct talks with Iran."" Speaking in the Oval Office beside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump said the U.S. and Iran would have ""a very big meeting"" on Saturday at ""almost the highest level.""

Overnight, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said on social media: ""Iran and the United States will meet in Oman on Saturday for indirect high-level talks.""

On Tuesday, Trump administration officials confirmed the location would be Oman, which neighbors Saudi Arabia, and they reiterated the president's position that these would be ""direct"" talks. State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said leading the U.S. team would be envoy Steve Witkoff, who has taken on a broad portfolio of global issues, from Ukraine to Gaza.

During Trump's first term, he withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran negotiated by former President Barack Obama and signed by several world powers. As a part of that deal, Iran agreed to limits and inspections on its nuclear development in return for relief from economic sanctions. When Trump withdrew from the deal in 2018, the U.S. imposed tough sanctions and what Trump called ""maximum pressure"" on the country.

An annual U.S. intelligence report made public last month said ""we continue to assess Iran is not building a nuclear weapon.""

Iran's leaders have rejected Trump's offers to engage in direct negotiations. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian cited America's ""breach of promises"" and said ""they must prove that they can build trust."" An aide to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Iran was open to indirect talks.

At Monday's press event with Netanyahu, Trump said the deal he wants would be ""different and maybe a lot stronger"" than the previous one he pulled out of.

He also issued a warning to Tehran. ""If the talks aren't successful with Iran, I think Iran is going to be in great danger,"" he said.

The Iranian foreign minister responded further in an opinion piece published Thursday in The Washington Post, saying Iran would not yield to threats.

""To move forward today, we first need to agree that there can be no 'military option,' let alone a 'military solution,' "" he said in the op-ed.

""We seek peace, but will never accept submission,"" he wrote. ""The ball is now in America's court."""

27.03.25,https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/donald-trump-new-york-fraud-debt-500-million/?intcid=CNM-00-10abd1h,"President Trump's debt to New York from a civil fraud judgment passed $500 million on Tuesday, as interest continues to accrue while he appeals.

The figure has been growing ever since a lengthy civil fraud trial ended with Mr. Trump, two of his sons and a former Trump Organization executive ordered to pay back $364 million in disgorgement for ""ill-gotten gains"" and $100 million more in interest dating back years.

They appealed the February 2024 judgment but interest has continued to build, at a rate of more than $114,000 per day. The total for all defendants hit $500 million on Dec. 29.

That figure is now nearly $512 million, and Mr. Trump's personal share — 98% of the total judgment — was at $500,070,167.42 on Tuesday morning, according to a spokesperson for New York Attorney General Letitia James, who brought the case against Trump and others.

James's office has said the judgement reflects the size of Mr. Trump's profits from fraud. The defendants were accused of a multi-year scheme to cheat banks and insurers by inflating property valuations and estimates of Mr. Trump's wealth.

James declined to comment Tuesday. Attorneys for Mr. Trump did not reply to requests for comment.

Judge Arthur Engoron said evidence proved ""over and over again"" that the defendants provided ""blatantly false financial data"" to Mr. Trump's business partners. Engoron concluded that the scheme allowed Mr. Trump and his company to gain massive windfalls through deal terms that they wouldn't have otherwise gotten.

Mr. Trump blamed his employees and others during several hours of testimony in November 2023. Trump said on the stand that his company ""underestimated"" the value of his properties, because the value of his brand was not being factored into the estimates at the heart of the case.

He claimed the case was brought in order to tarnish his reputation.

Soon after the judgment, Trump and his co-defendants brought the case to New York's Appellate Division, First Department. In September, at least two of five justices on the appeals panel appeared skeptical of the size of the judgment. One called it ""immense"" and ""troubling.""

Nearly six months later, the court has yet to rule, and the debt continues to grow."
27.03.25,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-ryan-routh-assassin-weapon-plane/?intcid=CNM-00-10abd1h,"Federal prosecutors say Ryan Routh, the man accused of trying to assassinate President Trump as he golfed last September during the 2024 campaign, also attempted to acquire an anti-aircraft weapon to shoot down Mr. Trump's plane.

In a filing Monday, the government said that in August, ""Routh sought to purchase the devices online from an associate Routh believed to be a Ukrainian with access to military weapons.""

Routh allegedly told an associate to ""'send me an rpg [rocket propelled grenade] or stinger and I will see what we can do,'"" according to the court document.

""I need equipment so that Trump cannot get elected,"" Routh told his associate.

The government said Routh also sought to purchase a .50 caliber rifle the same month, and this rifle would have been an even more destructive and powerful version of the one he had already allegedly obtained. Prosecutors said Routh hoped to purchase the .50 caliber rifle at a gun show, but his contact was ultimately not able to locate the type of gun Routh wanted until after the assassination attempt at the golf course.

Routh is suspected of hiding in some bushes with a gun near Trump International, about 300-500 yards away from Mr. Trump, who was then the Republican presidential nominee, while he was playing golf in West Palm Beach in September 2024. A member of Mr. Trump's Secret Service detail spotted his rifle in the tree line and opened fire at the suspect, who didn't fire back. He fled by car, and Routh was detained about 50 miles north of the golf course.

According to the Secret Service, Routh did not have a line of sight to Trump, who was playing a few holes away from where Routh was allegedly located.

In a court filing over the weekend, Routh's attorneys asked a judge to suppress statements from the eyewitness who identified him to police as the suspect at Mr. Trump's Florida golf course. Prosecutors say Routh had plotted to kill Mr. Trump for weeks beforehand.

Law enforcement said the eyewitness statement was critical to finding and then charging Routh.

Routh's defense alleged police induced or were ""impermissibly suggestive"" when questioning the witness, who was allegedly shown a single photograph of Routh taken after he was detained.

Routh's legal team claimed police created a situation in which an ""irreparable misidentification"" would occur and asked a judge to exclude the witness identification of Routh from the trial, which is scheduled to begin Sept. 8, 2025. The defense argued that the testimony would be ""constitutionally inadmissible"" in court."
27.03.25,https://www.cbsnews.com/miami/news/stock-market-today-dow-jones-sp-500-tariffs-04-08-25/?intcid=CNM-00-10abd1h,"Stocks shed their gains in the afternoon after an earlier rebound on Tuesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling 0.8% after the Trump administration said it will impose a 104% tariff on China beginning at 12:01 a.m. EDT Wednesday.

Tuesday's losses add to the three-day sell-off that has wiped out trillions in market value amid anxieties about the economic impact of President Trump's wide-ranging reciprocal tariffs.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 320 points, or 0.84%, to close at 37,645.59. The S&P 500 dropped 1.6%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index tumbled 2.2%.

What caused the selloff

The sell-off began on April 3, the day after Mr. Trump unveiled tariffs on imports from almost every nation, on top of a number of previously announced import duties targeting the auto, steel and aluminum industries, among others. Wall Street economists say the tariffs are likely to drive up inflation because they'll largely be passed onto consumers in the form of higher prices, which could stall U.S. economic growth and increase the risk of a recession.

But stocks rebounded early Tuesday, with some investors holding out hope that the tariffs could be pared back, with that optimism bolstered on Tuesday morning by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who told CNBC that the Trump administration is negotiating tariffs with a number of countries.

""I think we can end up with some good deals,"" Bessent said. ""And I actually think, as I said that over the weekend, President Trump has maximum negotiating leverage right here, right now, and I think it would be a mistake for anyone to think otherwise.""

Yet that optimism gave way to afternoon losses after White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said the White House will begin collecting steep levies on imported goods from China starting on Wednesday.

The 104% tariff rate is the result of an escalation in Mr. Trump's trade war, with the president on Monday threatening to slap an additional 50% tariff on imports from China after the nation said it would impose a 34% import fee on American products.

China's retaliatory move came after Mr. Trump said China would face a 34% tariff on all goods imported to the U.S., a rate tailored specifically to China.

""The tariff overhang isn't going away, even if some of the reciprocal numbers from the April 2 chart wind up getting trimmed a bit, and the huge disruptions to global trade will have a substantially negative effect on growth (especially since they hit at a time when the economy was already slowing), while pushing inflation higher,"" said Adam Crisafulli of Vital Knowledge in a research note.

Buying the dip

The rebound earlier in the day was partly due to investors seeking to buy stocks after they'd been knocked down, seizing the opportunity to buy shares at lower costs, some analysts noted. But the tariffs still remain in place, threatening the long-term growth of U.S. businesses, they added.

Corporate earnings season kicks off this week with Delta Air Lines reporting on Wednesday and major U.S. banks offering up their latest results on Friday. The airline sector, which had been forecasting a strong 2025, has been one of the hardest hit during Trump's tariff rollout.

Banks report their latest quarterly earnings on Friday, but most of the attention likely will be on their forecasts amid the rising global trade tensions ignited by Trump's tariffs.

On Thursday, the government posts its latest inflation data, which could play into the Federal Reserve's next interest rate decision. Many economists have raised their odds of a U.S. recession because of the tariffs and suggest the Fed may have to step in and cut rates to help spur economic growth.

27.03.25,https://www.cbsnews.com/pittsburgh/news/trump-executive-order-coal/?intcid=CNM-00-10abd1h,"President Trump signed four executive actions on Tuesday aimed at reversing policies that transitioned the country away from coal production and aimed at boosting America's ""beautiful clean coal industry,"" as the White House put it.

The actions are meant to help the U.S. achieve affordable and reliable energy by ""slashing unnecessary regulations,"" Mr. Trump said. The president said he's using the Defense Production Act to ""turbocharge"" coal mining in America. Mr. Trump also said his administration is working through the legalities of making it harder for companies to shut down coal plants.

""Today, we're taking historic action to help American workers, miners, families and consumers,"" Mr. Trump said in the White House East Room, flanked by men in coal mining uniforms and hard hats. ""We're ending Joe Biden's war on beautiful, clean coal once and for all. And it wasn't just Biden, it was Obama, and there were others. But we're doing the exact opposite. And all those plants that have been closed are going to be opened.""

President Donald Trump speaks during an executive order signing event in the East Room of the White House, Tuesday, April 8, 2025, in Washington. Alex Brandon / AP

Mr. Trump has had a long affinity for coal, as previous Democratic administrations and many developed nations have worked to move away from the fossil fuel toward renewable resources. The term ""clean coal"" typically refers to processes designed to reduce emissions from coal-fired power plants, but environmental groups say any coal combustion is harmful.

The president's move Tuesday defines coal as a ""mineral,"" which the administration says will give it more leeway on its use. The government has traditionally classified it as a nonrenewable fossil fuel. One of the executive orders directs agencies to lift barriers to coal mining on federal lands and prioritize coal leasing, formally ending an Obama-era moratorium against coal leasing on federal land. The president also directed federal agencies to rescind any policies transitioning the country away from coal production.

Another executive order the president signed Tuesday is meant to promote grid reliability, including by using fossil fuels. And yet another executive order Mr. Trump signed Tuesday directs the Justice Department to investigate states that are discriminating against coal.

""For years, people would just bemoan this industry and decimate the industry for absolutely no reason, because with modern technology and all of the other things that we do, it's one of the great, great forms of energy,"" Mr. Trump said Tuesday.

Mr. Trump has expressed a desire to harness U.S. coal, along with oil, natural gas and nuclear power, and this executive order is one of a number of actions he has taken to reverse Obama and Biden administration energy policies. The president has also withdrawn the U.S. from the Paris climate agreement, and declared a national emergency on energy, and he ended predecessor Joe Biden's efforts to encourage widespread EV adoption.

The president said coal miners want to mine coal, not work in high-tech jobs or other fields.

""You could give 'em a penthouse on Fifth Avenue and a different kind of job, and they'd be unhappy,"" Mr. Trump said, with the miners behind him. ""They want to mine coal. That's what they love to do.""

But despite Mr. Trump's emphasis on coal in his first term, coal production decreased slightly between 2016 before he took office and 2020, his final full year in office, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. And, in keeping with a trend in declining coal employment, there were fewer Americans working in the coal industry in January 2020 ahead of the COVID-19 pandemic than there were in January 2017 when he took office, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

No new coal plant has come online since 2013, during the Obama years, and the average age of the current fleet is 53 years old. Currently, coal makes up about 16% of the electricity mix in the U.S., down from 50% two decades ago.

As of this year, only about 41,000 Americans work in the coal industry. By comparison, solar energy employed nearly 280,000 Americans in 2023, according to the National Solar Job Census.

Environmental groups suggested Mr. Trump's executive order to reinvigorate coal will be a step backward.

""What's next, a mandate that Americans must commute by horse and buggy?"" Kit Kennedy, managing director for power at the National Resources Defense Council, said in a statement.

""Trump's coal orders take his worship of dirty fossil fuels to a gross and disturbingly reckless new level,"" said Jason Rylander of the Center for Biological Diversity's Climate Law Institute. ""Forcing old coal plants to keep spewing pollution into our air and water means more cancer, more asthma and more premature deaths.""

The Commerce Ministry said the U.S.'s imposition of ""so-called 'reciprocal tariffs'"" on China was ""completely groundless and is a typical unilateral bullying practice.""

China, the world's second-largest economy, has imposed retaliatory tariffs and the ministry hinted in its latest statement that more may be coming.

""The countermeasures China has taken are aimed at safeguarding its sovereignty, security and development interests, and maintaining the normal international trade order. They are completely legitimate,"" the ministry said. ""The U.S. threat to escalate tariffs on China is a mistake on top of a mistake and once again exposes the blackmailing nature of the U.S. China will never accept this. If the U.S. insists on its own way, China will fight to the end.""

Mr. Trump's threat Monday of additional tariffs on China raised fresh concerns that his drive to rebalance the global economy could intensify a financially destructive trade war. Stock markets from Tokyo to New York have become more unstable as the tariff war worsens and economists have warned that the odds of a global recession are rising fast.

Mr. Trump's threat came after China said it would retaliate against U.S. tariffs he announced last week.

""If China does not withdraw its 34% increase above their already long term trading abuses by tomorrow, April 8th, 2025, the United States will impose ADDITIONAL Tariffs on China of 50%, effective April 9th,"" the president wrote on his own Truth Social platform. ""Additionally, all talks with China concerning their requested meetings with us will be terminated!""

If Mr. Trump implements his new tariffs on Chinese products, U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods would reach a combined 104%. The new taxes would be on top of the 20% tariffs announced as punishment for fentanyl trafficking and his separate 34% tariffs announced last week. Not only could that increase prices for American consumers, it could also give China an incentive to flood other countries with cheaper goods and seek deeper relationships with other trading partners, particularly the European Union.

European Union Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called on China to negotiate with the EU to come up with solutions to the global challenges presented by the sweeping U.S. tariffs.

During a phone call with Chinese Prime Minister Li Qiang on Tuesday, Von der Leyen ""stressed the responsibility of Europe and China, as two of world's largest markets, to support a strong reformed trading system, free, fair and founded on a level playing field,"" according to a statement from her office.

The statement said the leaders had discussed establishing a mechanism to track any diversions of goods caused by the U.S. levies on trade, amid concern in Europe that China could try to divert cheap exports that had been destined for the U.S. to the EU market. Such diversions could amount to what is called ""dumping"" in international trade, a practice that can saturate a market with underpriced goods at the expense of domestic producers and sellers.

On the streets of Beijing, people said they found it hard to keep track of all the announcements, but expressed belief in their country's ability to weather the storm.

""Trump says one thing today and another tomorrow. Anyway, he just wants benefits, so he can say whatever he wants,"" said Wu Qi, 37, who works in construction.

""I'm not really worried,"" Wu said. ""Our country is not afraid. Of course, I think the goal should be to minimize harm to ordinary people.""

China still has a range of options to strike back at Washington, experts say, including suspending cooperation on combating fentanyl, placing higher quotas on agricultural products and going after the U.S. trade in services in China, such as finance and law firms.

U.S. total goods trade with China was worth an estimated $582 billion in 2024, making it the top trader in goods with the U.S. The 2024 U.S. deficit with China in goods and services trade was between $263 billion and $295 billion."
25.03.25,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cx2w0jdn8rdo,"Its quarterly survey, in partnership with accountancy firm BDO, involved 151 firms and was carried out before Trump's tariffs announcement.

It showed that Northern Ireland's performance was strong in the first three months of this year, despite pressures around high labour costs and the rising cost of raw materials.

In particular, Northern Ireland's export performance was strong, surpassing the UK average.

Almost half of the 151 firms that took part in the survey said they had experienced a slowdown in demand in the first quarter of this year, although for most, this was only a small slowdown.

In the wake of the Trump tariffs, there are now fears that some of those concerns businesses are grappling with, such as inflation and competitiveness, will be exacerbated.

She said that most businesses, according to a survey by the British Chambers, are saying they want negotiation as opposed to retaliatory tariffs and she thinks would be the case in Northern Ireland as well.

""I think we need to wait and see how the negotiations happen. It's obviously a moving feast, but the clarity is not really going to come until we have the negotiations and we see the outcome of those,"" she added."
23.03.25,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/crm332189djo,"US President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs targeting most of the world are now in effect – and outside China, no other region has been hit as hard as South East Asia.

Near the top of the list are Vietnam and Cambodia which have been hit by some of the highest tariffs: 46% and 49%. Further down are Thailand (36%), Indonesia (32%) and Malaysia (24%). The Philippines gets a tariff of 17%, and Singapore of 10%.

This is a huge blow for a region highly dependent on exports. Its widely-admired economic development over the past three decades has largely been driven by its success in selling its products to the rest of the world, in particular to the US.

Exports to the US contribute 23% of Vietnam's GDP, and 67% of Cambodia's.

That growth story is now imperilled by the punitive measures being imposed in Washington.

The longer-term impact of these tariffs, assuming they stay in place, will vary, but will certainly pose big challenges to the governments of Vietnam, Thailand and Cambodia in particular."

If you were raised in the 1970s, it will be the fledgling New York property developer working on renovating some of the city’s most iconic buildings with what he would later describe as a “small loan of a million dollars” from his father.

In the 80s, the now-accomplished businessman became widely known for his New York Times bestseller, The Art of the Deal, in which he detailed the path to his riches.

OPINION: Donald Trump – The Islamophobia president

The 90s made Trump a fixture of popular culture as the owner of the Miss Universe beauty pageant and a cameo actor in some of the decade’s most popular TV shows and movies, including Home Alone 2, Sex and the City and the Fresh Prince of Bel Air.

By the turn of the millennium, Trump reached global stardom with the TV show The Apprentice. His signature phrase, “You’re fired”, aimed at losing contestants on the show, took on a life of its own as one of the staple catchphrases of the reality TV era.

The jump between business and politics has never been grand, and Trump flirted with the idea of several political candidacies from the 80s onwards.

For two decades from 1988, the property mogul drifted between the Democrats and the Republicans but finally settled on the latter after the election of current US President Barack Obama, towards whom he quickly established a vicious enmity.

Trump helped promulgate conspiracy theories that the US leader had lied about being born in the US, therefore invalidating his right to the presidency.

Despite ready accessibility to evidence that Obama was born in the United States, Trump only accepted this during the later stages of his current run for presidency in 2016.

Trump’s run at the presidency marked an ascent that has defied expectation from political analysts, the media, and rivals in both major US parties alike.

Trump has survived not only the fallout from his populist rhetorical outbursts during the campaign but also revelations dating back decades involving racism, sexual harassment, tax avoidance, among other accusations.

REPORTER’S NOTEBOOK: Donald Trump viewed from Russia

A pledge to ban Muslims from entering the US, calling immigrants from Mexico rapists, attacking the family of a US soldier killed in Iraq, mocking a disabled New York Times reporter, leaks detailing boasts of unsolicited sexual advances in graphic detail – Trump has survived the fallout of all plus more.

Even though most polls gave his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton a slight edge, Trump won because he had the backing of large swaths of the country, for whom he – the self-proclaimed outsider – is a voice of protest against the establishment.

22.03.25,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/7/trump-claims-direct-us-talks-with-iran-on-nuclear-deal-have-begun,"Tehran confirms talks will happen on Saturday, but at odds with Trump’s claim of direct negotiations.

Iran has said it would hold talks with the United States over its nuclear programme, confirming an earlier announcement by President Donald Trump.

Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi wrote on social media late on Monday that “indirect” talks would take place on Saturday. Iranian state media later reported that Araghchi would meet the US envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, with Oman acting as a mediator.

Earlier, Trump had announced the start of “direct” talks, while maintaining threatening rhetoric suggesting the US could attack Iran. Tehran had earlier dismissed Washington’s calls for the talks.

“We’re having direct talks with Iran, and they’ve started. It’ll go on Saturday. We have a very big meeting, and we’ll see what can happen,” Trump told reporters at the White House on Monday, alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

“And I think everybody agrees that doing a deal would be preferable,” he added, without providing further details.

Trump also warned that Iran would be in “great danger” if diplomatic efforts to curb its nuclear ambitions failed, adding that Tehran “can’t have nuclear weapons”.

Earlier this month, Trump told NBC News: “If they [Iran] don’t make a deal, there will be bombing.”

He added that the bombing would be “the likes of which they have never seen before”.

Trump’s announcement of direct talks with Tehran would not be to Netanyahu’s “liking”, as the Israeli leader has long wanted to simply bomb Iran, said Marwan Bishara, Al Jazeera’s senior political analyst.

“Trump has wanted a deal for a long time,” Bishara said. However, “Netanyahu certainly thinks Iran’s defences have been weakened by last year’s Israeli air strikes on Iran. And he sees this as a great opportunity, with US support, for Israel to finish off Iran.”

“In reality, Trump doesn’t want to enter a war with Iran while he is in the midst of trade wars with the rest of the world,” Bishara added.

‘Meaningless talks’

Trump said last month in a letter to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei that he hoped there would be a negotiation between the countries.

Over the weekend, Araghchi had described the prospect of direct talks as “meaningless”.

Tehran, which maintains that it is not seeking a nuclear weapon, has rejected Washington’s push to enter direct negotiations but has previously said it is open to indirect diplomacy.

Iranian media reported on Tuesday that Oman’s Foreign Minister Badr Albusaidi will act as a mediator in the talks. Oman has long acted as a communication channel between the US and Iran.

It also played a crucial role in the signing of the 2015 nuclear agreement between Iran and world powers which placed strict curbs on Tehran’s nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief. Trump withdrew from that deal in 2018.

Nournews, affiliated with Iran’s top security body, described Trump’s claim that direct talks were planned as part of a “psychological operation aimed at influencing domestic and international public opinion”.

China, which hosted talks with Iran and Russia over the issue this week, was quick following Tehran’s confirmation to urge Washington to show “sincerity”.

“As the country that unilaterally withdrew from the comprehensive agreement on the Iran nuclear issue and caused the current situation, the US should demonstrate political sincerity [and] … mutual respect,” Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Lin Jian said.

Iran says its nuclear activities are solely for civilian purposes. Israel, the US’s top ally in the region, is widely believed to have an undeclared nuclear arsenal.

Netanyahu calls for Palestinians to leave Gaza

Speaking next to Netanyahu, who has been issued an arrest warrant by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for alleged war crimes in Gaza, Trump suggested that the war in the Palestinian enclave could end soon.

“I’d like to see the war stop, and I think the war will stop at some point that won’t be in the too-distant future,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. However, he did not provide specifics on how or when a ceasefire might be reached.

Netanyahu claimed that Israel was working on a new agreement following January’s temporary ceasefire, which he broke unilaterally in March before unleashing more bombing on Gaza and killing hundreds more Palestinians.

“We’re committed to getting all the hostages out, but also eliminating the evil tyranny of Hamas in Gaza and enabling the people of Gaza to freely make a choice to go wherever they want,” he said.

The Israeli leader also said he had discussed with Trump what he called the US president’s “bold vision” for Gaza, referring to a controversial proposal for US control over the enclave.

The plan, widely condemned as a blueprint for ethnic cleansing, has drawn sharp criticism internationally.

Luciano Zaccara, assistant professor in Gulf politics at Qatar University, said the comments did not reveal any change in policy towards Gaza.

“Both share the belief that fewer people in Gaza is better – for the United States and Israel,” Zaccara told Al Jazeera.

The word “ceasefire” barely came up in the media conference, said Zaccara, adding, “Trump’s main focus was business, trade deficits, and corporate deals, including with Israel. He was not paying much attention to Gaza as a whole, except when discussing expelling Palestinians from their land.”

US looks to mediate between Turkiye and Israel

Turning to Syria, Trump positioned himself as a potential mediator between Israel and Turkiye, despite tensions between Netanyahu and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

“Any problem that you have with Turkey, I think we can solve, as long as you are reasonable,” Trump told Netanyahu.

“I have a very, very good relationship with Turkey and with their leader, and I think we’ll be able to work it out. So I hope that’s not going to be a problem. I don’t think it will be a problem,” added Trump.

Trump, who described Erdogan as “very smart”, praised Turkiye’s role in Syria, referring to the overthrow of leader Bashar al-Assad in December. “Nobody has done in 2,000 years what Turkey has done in Syria,” he said.

Israel, which has carried out extensive air attacks against Syrian military targets, remains wary of Turkiye’s growing influence in Syria.

Israeli officials fear that a permanent Turkish military presence in Syria could limit their operational freedom to attack Syria."

22.03.25,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/6/over-50-countries-seek-us-trade-talks-after-tariffs-trump-officials,"The tariffs have been widely criticised around the world for threatening to push the global economy into a recession.

More than 50 countries have directly contacted the White House to initiate trade talks following US President Donald Trump’s imposition of wide-ranging punitive tariffs, administration officials have said.

The tariffs, which caused a nearly $6 trillion drop in US stock values last week and battered global markets, have drawn worldwide attention and sparked fears of a potential economic downturn. But the Trump administration has downplayed that and potential further catastrophic economic fallout.

In the meantime, investors nervously awaited the open of US trading after Wall Street’s selloff last week, anticipating another week of turbulence as other nations react. Asian markets will open in the coming hours and expect a rocky day.

In a series of Sunday-morning talk show interviews, Trump’s top economic advisers defended the tariffs, describing them as a strategic move to strengthen the US position in global trade.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent revealed that more than 50 nations had begun negotiations with the US since the tariffs were announced on Wednesday, but did not disclose the countries involved.

Bessent claimed the tariffs gave Trump “maximum leverage,” though their impact on the US economy remains uncertain. He dismissed concerns about a recession, citing unexpectedly strong job growth in the US.

Trump’s wide-ranging tariffs came into effect on Saturday.

The initial 10 percent “baseline” tariff took effect at US seaports, airports and customs warehouses, ushering in Trump’s full rejection of the post-World War II system of mutually agreed tariff rates.

A decline in US GDP

Despite this, economists have warned that the tariffs could lead to a decline in US gross domestic product (GDP), with JPMorgan economists revising their growth forecast from a 1.3 percent increase to a 0.3 percent decrease.

The tariffs, aimed at pressuring foreign governments to make concessions, have also triggered retaliatory levies, including hefty ones from China, raising fears of a global trade war.

US allies like Taiwan, Israel, India, and Italy have already expressed interest in negotiating with the US to avoid the tariffs.

Taiwanese leader Lai Ching-te offered zero tariffs as the basis for talks, while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sought relief from the 17 percent tariff on Israeli goods.

Meanwhile, the US continues to implement tariffs, with higher “reciprocal” duties expected to take effect on Wednesday.
